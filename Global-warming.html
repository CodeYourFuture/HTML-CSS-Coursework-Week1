    <h3>BE A FORCE FOR THE FUTURE</h3>
    <p>Earth is warming up, and humans are at least partially to blame. The causes, effects, and complexities of global warming are important to understand so that we can fight for the health of our planet.</p>

                    <p>The climate crisis is here, and it demands urgent action from all of us. To avoid the most dangerous impacts, we must limit warming to 1.5 degrees Celsius by the end of the century. And we can’t wait a second longer. Luckily, we already have the tools we need to meet this goal and improve people’s lives—through new jobs, better health, and long overdue justice for communities of color that are already the hardest hit by climate change.

                    <h3>The United States Finally Joins a Global Climate Treaty That Phases Down HFCs</h3>
                    <p>They may not be as high-profile as the greenhouse gases carbon dioxide or methane, but hydrofluorocarbons (HFCs) have long spelled similar disaster for the climate.
HFCs are the manmade chemicals commonly used in air conditioners, refrigerators, insulating foams, and other applications. But when they leak into the air, they pack hundreds—even thousands—of times the heat-trapping punch of carbon dioxide.
Climate scientists began sounding the alarm on HFCs more than a decade ago, warning that if we let them keep increasing, these pollutants could raise global temperatures by as much as half a degree Celsius by 2100.
Remarkably, and in a rare display of global coordination on climate action, world leaders listened and agreed to phase them down. And this October, the United States formally ratified the Kigali Amendment, an international climate treaty that commits the 145 participating countries to reducing total HFC production 80 to 85 percent by the late 2040s. The treaty amends the famously successful Montreal Protocol, which phased out chlorofluorocarbons (the precursors to HFCs) and is credited with saving the once-deteriorating ozone layer.
The global agreement—backed by environmental and industry groups as well as lawmakers on both sides of the aisle—is the culmination of more than a decade of diplomacy, policymaking, and advocacy. It was shaped at every step of the way by NRDC leadership and expertise.</p>
