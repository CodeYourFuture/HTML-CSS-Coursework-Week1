# Notes

- What did you find easy?
The parent and child element is css, I didnt think I could do it at first but I feel I understood it better when using it. 

- What did you find hard?
Styling the contact form, I made it alot smaller, just to keep styling easier, but I am going to have to find out how to do this better. 

- What do you still not understand?
My site is not responsive, I struggled with media queries, I did play around with them on this project but because I was unable to get the working 100% correct, I removed them so I can do some further reading and I know our lessons have not covered them yet, also I could not see that they was required on this project too, so I hope it has been fine for me to leave them out for now.   

- Any other notes?
