# Notes

- What did you find easy?

Writing the HTML content was easy

- What did you find hard?

Using CSS for styling. There were a few things such as Media queries I wanted to add. Once I did it, they did not seem to make the changes I wanted.

- What do you still not understand?

I think flex in general is still confusing. I have difficulties placing things on the page in my preferred location.

- Any other notes?

I believe a lot of practice, knowledge, lectures and projects are required to come up with solutions.
