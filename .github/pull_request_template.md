# Notes

- What did you find easy?
I really enjoy creating the HTML structure because I find it quite easy to understand and work with.

- What did you find hard?
I find it quite hard to do the debugging. I was also struggling a bit to arrange the content of the page using CSS.  

- What do you still not understand?
I don't feel very confident using the Inspect Tool, I guess I need more practice to get used to it.
Another thing I don't completely understand is CSS flexbox. I find CSS flexbox quite complex and a bit tricky.

- Any other notes?
I really enjoyed working on this project and I am pretty happy with the result. With every step forward I was feeling more engaged and determined to improve the website. I am looking forward to the next challenges.
