            <h1>How it all Began</h1>
            <p>The Covid-19 pandemic began last year in a city in central China, but has since grown to affect nearly every country on
            earth. The virus has put world leaders in hospital while exposing inequality. It has asked major questions of
            governments and encroached on the daily lives of billions. And it shows no signs of ending any time soon.
            </p>
            <p>The biggest story emerged from China, which the BBC first reported as a cluster of cases of a "mysterious viral
            pneumonia" in the city of Wuhan.
            </p>
            <p>There were also fears the virus could spread rapidly as hundreds of millions of people in China prepared to travel
            around the country for Chinese New Year.
            But it was still unclear how the illness was transmitted, with health officials saying no cases of human-to-human
            transmission had been confirmed.
            At that point, the World Health Organization (WHO) said it was aware of the outbreak, it was in contact with the Chinese
            government and it was closely monitoring the event.
            By the end of the month, the toll had passed 100, with infections rising fast. It spread beyond Wuhan, both into other
            parts of China and to at least 16 countries around the world.

                <h3 class="title">Managing Covid 19</h3>
               <p>If you have a high temperature, it can help to:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>get lots of rest, drink plenty of fluids (water is best) to avoid dehydration – drink enough so your pee is light yellow and clear, take paracetamol or ibuprofen if you feel uncomfortable</li> 
                    <li>If you have a cough, it's best to avoid lying on your back. Lie on your side or sit upright instead, To help ease a cough, try having a teaspoon of honey. But do not give honey to babies under 12 months.</li>
                    <li>If this does not help, you could contact a pharmacist for advice about cough treatments.</li>
