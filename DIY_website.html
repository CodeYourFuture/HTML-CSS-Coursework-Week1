            <h1>How it all Began</h1>
            <p>The Covid-19 pandemic began last year in a city in central China, but has since grown to affect nearly every country on
            earth. The virus has put world leaders in hospital while exposing inequality. It has asked major questions of
            governments and encroached on the daily lives of billions. And it shows no signs of ending any time soon.
            </p>
            <p>The biggest story emerged from China, which the BBC first reported as a cluster of cases of a "mysterious viral
            pneumonia" in the city of Wuhan.
            </p>
            <p>There were also fears the virus could spread rapidly as hundreds of millions of people in China prepared to travel
            around the country for Chinese New Year.
            But it was still unclear how the illness was transmitted, with health officials saying no cases of human-to-human
            transmission had been confirmed.
            At that point, the World Health Organization (WHO) said it was aware of the outbreak, it was in contact with the Chinese
            government and it was closely monitoring the event.
            By the end of the month, the toll had passed 100, with infections rising fast. It spread beyond Wuhan, both into other
            parts of China and to at least 16 countries around the world.
