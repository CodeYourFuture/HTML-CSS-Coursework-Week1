    <h1>Hamsi</h1>
    <p>Hamsi Tava aka anchovies from the pan come from the Black Sea - here specifically Turkey. However, similar
      recipes are also known from the region formerly known as the Balkans or further east. It's so simple and so good
      at the same time! You just need a bit of courage and not to be afraid of hot oil.

      Speaking of not being afraid of hot oil: please always be careful when handling it. With this preparation, it is
      more than helpful to use a shallow pan and to use a lid that fits almost exactly into the pan. </p>

      <h4>Coking instructions</h4>
      <h5>Step 1</h5>
      Actually, you pack everything in a bowl and bread the fish more or less as thickly as you like. They have to be
      cleaned and patted dry beforehand.
      <h5>Step 2</h5>
      Depending on the size of the pans, line them up on the oil and press the fillets very close together so that they
      can stick together in the end.
      <h5>Step 3</h5>
      Once you can see the bottom beginning to brown, have a lid ready that fits the pan snugly. Press the fillets
      firmly, pour off the oil, turn the pan completely upside down and turn the fillets by sliding them off the lid
      back into the pan. Put the oil back on and repeat until all the fillets are done. Finished!
      <h5>Step 4</h5>
      Actually, you don't have to season them, but I think a grilled lemon is great with it or small sumac onions. It is
      customary to eat Hamsi with rye bread or corn bread.
