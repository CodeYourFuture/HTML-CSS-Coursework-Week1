Origins
The style of Roses and Castles likely developed in the 1850s, approaching the decline of the British canal system and at a time when rail was proving a more popular method of 
transporting goods.[2] A false origin of the style suggests that it originates from the Llangollen Canal in the early 20th century, where a lengthsman
 grew an abundance of roses and had a picturesque view of Chirk Castle from his garden. In reality, the movement had been well established since 1858.
  A number of theories to the origin of the design exist. Similarities have been drawn between the style and that used on vardos by Romani people;
 it is possible that some Romanis took up employment as boatmen and brought their designs with them onto the waterways.
 In this instance, the suggested influence of castles on the artwork comes from castles in the Carpathian Mountains.[5
Another explanation is that the style originated with a dog-rose design painted by one boatman (or his family) and grew from there; alternatively,
 it has been noted that the garland of roses design bears resemblance to decorations applied to Sheraton furniture at the turn of the 19th century.
 It is probable that the design originated from the Birmingham and Black Country area.[7] The use of roses predated the addition of castles; 
 the earliest recorded use of castles in narrowboat decoration is from 1873.
