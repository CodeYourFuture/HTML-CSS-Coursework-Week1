        <h2>Lox Bagel</h2>

        <p>Traditionally, bagels are not made with milk, hence vejahn. Sometimes, however, the water is replaced
            entirely with milk for a more brioche-like consistency. But we don't want that!

            </li>
            <li> 355 grams of water
            </li>
            <li>
                1 packet of yeast
            </li>
            <li>1 tablespoon of sugar
            </li>
            <li>1 tsp salt
            </li>
            <li>2 tablespoons sugar for the cooking water
            </li>
            <li>Sesame, poppy, zaatar, u name it
            </li>
            <li>1 egg or some soy milk for brushing
            </li>
        </ul>
        </p>


        <h3>Preparation
        </h3>
        <ol>
            <li>If you want to do it with Saui:</li>
            <li>The day before, mix 25 g starter, 50 g water and 50 g flour into the pre-dough. Mix with the water the
                next day, just add 2 g of yeast. Reduce the amount of flour and water from the list above accordingly.
            </li>
            <li>Dissolve the yeast and sugar in warm water and leave to foam for 10-15 minutes at room temperature. Add
                flour and salt and knead into a dough until it is no longer sticky. Add a little more flour if you need
                it, but it should come from kneading. Cover and leave to stand for 40-60 minutes until the dough has
                doubled in size.
            </li>
            <li>Divide into 8 pieces of about the same size, shape into a ball and poke a hole in the middle. Put a
                chopstick or wooden spoon in the hole and swing the bagels quickly to enlarge the hole. Cover and let
                rise again for 20-30 minutes.
            </li>
            <li>Let them soak in boiling water for 2 minutes on each side and place on baking paper. Spread with Eggwash
                and top as desired. In the oven at 200 degrees for 20-25 minutes.
                Finished! </li>
