            <h5>Step 1</h5>
            Dough is the key here is to make the dough the day before or let it rise in the fridge for at least 6 hours
            and only let it rise in the babka shape. If you process the dough warm, it is simply too soft and you end up
            with a huge mess and heckling when processing it.
            <h5>Step 2</h5>
            To do this, dissolve the butter in the milk by heating it up, do not let it boil, stir in the remaining
            ingredients and knead until smooth for at least 10-15 minutes.
            <h5>Step 3</h5>
            The flour doesn't have to be completely pure. Those who can handle a wetter dough prefer to stick with less
            flour. Leave to rise in an oiled bowl in the fridge overnight or at room temperature for 1.5 hours.
            <h5>Step 4</h5>
            For the chocolate filling, simply melt all the ingredients over a water bath and stir well together until
            smooth. Let cool before filling.
            <h5> Step 5</h5>
            Now fill the babka and let it rise. To do this, halve the dough and roll out to about 0.8 cm thick. The flat
            cake should be about 40Ã—50 cm in size. Spread half of the chocolate filling on top and roll up from the long
            side, pinching the ends tightly so the filling doesn't spill out. When your dough is nice and cold, the
            filling should set right away and be more manageable.
            <h5>Step 6</h5>
            When both flat cakes are filled, the two rolls can be cut open lengthwise and braided. The technique is
            secondary. If you are doing Babka for the first time, it is best to twist the two strands around each other.
            Then the babka can rise in a loaf pan for 1 hour or you could twist it into a snail to have a round babka.
            If you want, you can also use all 4 strands directly for braiding. Either way, the finished braided babka
            should rest covered on baking paper or in a loaf tin for at least 1 hour.
            <h5>Step 7</h5>
            Now preheat the oven to 180 degrees, brush the babka with beaten egg and bake for 30-40 minutes. If the
            chocolate darkens too quickly, simply cover with aluminum foil.
            <h5>Step 8</h5>
            When the babka is ready, prepare the syrup and wet the entire surface with it. For the syrup it is actually
            enough to just dissolve the sugar in water with a little lemon. I like to throw a lot of spices in there.
            Cardamom and lots of lemon are my favorites for dark chocolate.
