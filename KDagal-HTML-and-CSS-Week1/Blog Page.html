              <h3>3. Heal wounds</h3>
                <p>
                  Manuka honey is used in medical settings to treat wounds because it’s been found to be an effective germ killer and also aids in tissue regeneration.<br/> 
                  Studies show that Manuka honey can boost healing time and reduce infection. <br/>
                   Keep in mind that the honey used in hospital settings is medical grade, meaning it’s inspected and sterile. <br/> 
                   It’s not a good idea to treat cuts with honey you buy from a store.
