      <h3 class="product_title">iPhone 12 Pro Max </h3>
      <p>
        The iPhone 12 Pro Max is one of the best phones you can buy and is that rare phone
        that is practically perfect, especially for those who prefer big screens.
        You get an immersive 6.7-inch OLED display, class-leading A14 Bionic performance
        and 5G capability. But the iPhone 12 Pro Max really stands out with its long battery life,
        as it lasted nearly 11 hours on our web surfing test.
        It’s the longest-lasting iPhone 12 model by far.
        Like the regular iPhone 12 Pro, the iPhone 12 Pro Max packs three rear cameras,
        but it benefits from a larger main sensor that lets in more light.
        And you get a 2.5 telephoto zoom, compared to 2x for the regular Pro.
        The iPhone 12 Pro Max also delivers amazingly colorful video recording in Dolby Vision,
        complete with sensor-shift stabilization for steady footage.
        At $1,099, the iPhone 12 Pro Max isn’t cheap, but overall it’s the best phone
        we’ve ever tested.

      <h3 class="product_title">Asus ROG Zephyrus G14 </h3>
      <p>
        Asus has teamed up with AMD to double down on the trend of increasingly compact
        gaming laptops with the ROG Zephyrus G14,
        a 14-inch near-ultraportable with full gaming capabilities.
        The main attraction here beyond the petite size is a brand-new AMD Ryzen 9 processor,
        the first "Zen 2" laptop CPU we've tested. We're happy to report that it's blistering
        fast across the board, equally ready for gaming and media workloads, and superior
        to the competition. Intel, on the other hand, will not be happy; this efficient CPU is
        also a great value, and Team Red now threatens its hold on the mobile market.
        This processor is just one (major) aspect of the full Zephyrus G14 package:
        an attractive and portable package with high frame rates, and our new midrange
        gaming Editors’ Choice.

      <h3 class="product_title">Sony Bravia A8H OLED TV </h3>
      <p>
        The Sony A8H is an excellent OLED TV that delivers incredible picture quality for any
        type of content and is a fairly decent upgrade over its predecessor, the Sony A8G OLED.
        It produces perfect blacks with its infinite contrast ratio, which is great for those
        who like to watch in a dark room. It handles reflections exceptionally well,
        and its decent peak brightness is enough to fight glare in brighter lighting conditions.
        It has wide viewing angles, so the image remains accurate even if you're sitting off
        to the side. Its response time is almost instantaneous and it has a low input lag;
        however, gamers might find the lack of variable refresh rate (VRR) support a bit
        disappointing. As always, there's a risk of permanent burn-in with OLED panels,
        although it shouldn't be an issue for most. Its Android TV platform is user-friendly,
        it runs smoothly, and you should have no problems finding what you need from the immense
        Google Play Store.
