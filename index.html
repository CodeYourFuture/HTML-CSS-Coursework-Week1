          <h2>Freaky Facts about Otis</h2>
          <ul>
            <li>While Otis had the voice of a sweet angel, he was built like a brick house. Otis stood 6’2″ tall and weighed over 220 lbs. To compare, that would make him about the same size as four-time world heavyweight boxing champion Evander “The Real Deal” Holyfield.</li>
            <li>When he was a teenager, he won a local talent competition (and the $5 cash prize) 15 TIMES IN A ROW! After his 15th consecutive victory the organizers asked him to stop competing so other people would have a chance to win.</li>
            <li>As a youngster, Otis would earn $6 for his family by singing gospel tunes every Sunday on Macon, Georgia radio station WIBB.</li>
            <li>Otis was so popular in England that he ended Elvis Presley’s eight-year reign as “world’s best male vocalist” on Melody Maker’s annual poll in 1967. When he arrived in England for his 1967 tour he was greeted by The Beatles’ personal limo.</li>
            <li>On March 16, 1968, Redding’s recording of “(Sittin’ On) The Dock Of The Bay” became the first posthumous #1 hit in the Billboard chart history.</li>

            <p> It did not take long before Otis found his rhythm, first through his recordings of popular ballads, and later by writing, recording, and performing his own songs. Some of his greatest work includes, “These Arms of Mine,” “Try A Little Tenderness,” “Respect” (yes, that Respect), “Mr. Pitiful,” and “(Sittin’ On) The Dock of the Bay.” At the height of his career, “Dock of the Bay” would become Otis Redding‘s most successful song, with its final version recorded just days before his untimely death at the age of 26. “Dock of the Bay” marked a transition in Otis’ career that was highlighted by his masterful expression of soul, coupled with the gentle despair of the blues.
