        <p>Art is a diverse range of human activity, and resulting product, that 
          involves creative or imaginative talent expressive of technical 
          proficiency, beauty, emotional power, or conceptual ideas.
There is no generally agreed definition of what constitutes art, and 
its interpretation has varied greatly throughout history and across cultures. 
The three classical branches of visual art are painting, sculpture, and architecture. 
Theatre, dance, and other performing arts, as well as literature, music, film and other 
media such as interactive media, are included in a broader definition of the arts. 
Until the 17th century, art referred to any skill or mastery and was not differentiated 
from crafts or sciences. In modern usage after the 17th century, where aesthetic 
considerations are paramount, the fine arts are separated and distinguished from 
acquired skills in general, such as the decorative or applied arts.
