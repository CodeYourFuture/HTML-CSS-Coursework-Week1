      <h1>Spy × Family</h1>
      <p class="desc">
        This page is going to introduce three main characters in the animation.
        Spy × Family is a Japanese manga series written and illustrated by
        Tatsuya Endo. The story follows a spy who has to "build a family" to
        execute a mission, not realizing that the girl he adopts as his daughter
        is a telepath, and the woman he agrees to be in a marriage with is a
        skilled assassin.

        <p class="desc">
          As a young child, Anya is very impressionable towards the people
          around her. For instance, reading Loid's mind and acting in ways he
          found very odd and learning how to punch from Yor. Given her
          telepathic ability ostracizing her from people and her many foster
          homes, she instantly took to "Twilight" for being a real spy. Since
          being adopted, she wanted to go wherever Loid was going in hopes of
          seeing the spy stuff she always sees on TV. But, after the events of
          Chapter 1, she has learned of the harshness of espionage and stopped
          messing with Loid's spy work. She is quite clever being able to spell
          long words by herself and helping Loid out as best she can, even
          nudging Loid and Yor together. She likes watching spy cartoons, her
          favorite being "Spy Wars", and is often seen watching them whenever
          she can.

        <p class="desc">
          Befitting of a spy, his true personality is rather cold and
          methodical, doing whatever it takes to complete the mission, from
          joining terrorist organizations to dating his target's daughter to
          becoming a father. However, he is shown to have a kind personality as
          shown when he rescued Anya Forger, even risking his identity as a spy.

        <span>Yor Forger</span>

          <br
        />
        <p class="desc">
          Yor lacks social skills and initially comes across as a somewhat aloof
          individual, interacting minimally with her coworkers and being rather
          straightforward, and she's described by Camilla as a robot. Similarly,
          Yor is remarkably collected, able to keep her composure in the midst
          of combat. She is incredibly polite to the point of asking her
          assassination targets for "the honor of taking their lives." Despite
          her job, Yor is a genuinely kind person with a strong maternal and big
          sister instincts. After becoming a family with Loid and Anya, Yor
          becomes more expressive and opens up to her coworkers, asking for help
          on being a better wife or cooking. She is protective of her faux
          family, especially towards Anya whom she has no trouble defending with
          extreme violence.
