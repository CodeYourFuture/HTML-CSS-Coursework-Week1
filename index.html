            The Nobel Peace Prize is one of the five Nobel Prizes established by
            the will of Swedish industrialist, inventor and armaments (military
            weapons and equipment) manufacturer Alfred Nobel, along with the
            prizes in Chemistry, Physics, Physiology or Medicine and Literature.
            Since March 1901, it has been awarded annually (with some
            exceptions) to those who have "done the most or the best work for
            fraternity between nations, for the abolition or reduction of
            standing armies and for the holding and promotion of peace
            congresses".
          </p>
          <p>
            In accordance with Alfred Nobel's will, the recipient is selected by
            the Norwegian Nobel Committee, a five-member committee appointed by
            the Parliament of Norway. Since 2020 the prize is awarded in the
            Atrium of the University of Oslo, where it was also awarded
            1947–1989; the Abel Prize is also awarded in the building. The prize
            was previously awarded in Oslo City Hall (1990–2019), the Norwegian
            Nobel Institute (1905–1946), and the Parliament (1901–1904). Due to
            its political nature, the Nobel Peace Prize has, for most of its
            history, been the subject of numerous controversies. The most recent
            prize for 2021 was awarded to Maria Ressa and Dmitry Muratov.

            In 2018, Mukwege and Iraqi Yazidi human rights activist Nadia Murad

          <h2>Maria Ressa</h2>
          <h3>Maria Angelita Ressa Nobel Peace Price, 2021</h3>

          <p>
            Maria Angelita Ressa (Tagalog pronunciation: [ˈɾesa], born on
            October 2, 1963) is a Filipino-American journalist and author, the
            co-founder and CEO of Rappler, and the first Filipino recipient of
            the Nobel Peace Prize. She previously spent nearly two decades
            working as a lead investigative reporter in Southeast Asia for CNN.
          </p>
          <p>
            Ressa was included in Time's Person of the Year 2018 issue as one of
            a collection of journalists from around the world combating fake
            news. On February 13, 2019, she was arrested by Philippine
            authorities for cyberlibel due to accusations that Rappler published
            a false news story concerning businessman Wilfredo Keng. On June 15,
            2020, a court in Manila found her guilty of cyberlibel under the
            controversial Anti-Cybercrime law, a move condemned by human rights
            groups and journalists as an attack on press freedom. As she is a
            prominent critic of Philippine President Rodrigo Duterte, her arrest
            and conviction was seen by many in the opposition and the
            international community as apolitically motivated act by Duterte's
            government. Ressa is one of the 25 leading figures on the
            Information and Democracy Commission launched by Reporters Without
            Borders. She was awarded the 2021 Nobel Peace Prize jointly with
            Dmitry Muratov for "their efforts to safeguard freedom of
            expression, which is a precondition for democracy and lasting
            peace."
