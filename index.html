            <h2>Why Indoor Cycling?</h2>
            <p>Cycling is a great exercise when the weather is good, but it is not the case here in the UK. With indoor cycling, you can have the fun without becoming dirty. It is fun and you can exercise to target different areas. Though, I still love the
                outdoors. I do not have a bike and I can not have a bike because I live in a flat and I do not have a garage to store my bike. So, I do indoor cycling and I find it a great exercise to do</p>

            <h2>Indoor Cycling Benefits</h2>
            <p>The reason I joined the gym is to do indoor cycling because I do not have the space on my flat or the money to buy a bike. Also, I wanted to improve my health as I suffer from diabetes and I found exercising on my own a bit tedious. I do recommend
                going to the gym and doing indoor cycling with an instructor. It is fun and motivating. The benefits are many and include cardiovascular benefits as well as building strength and burning calories</p>

            <p>The first thing you need to know is indoor bikes are different from outdoor bikes. Also, exercising indoors has an etiquette such as cleaning your bike before and after you exercise. The most important thing is you have consider how you adjust
                your bike so you do not injure yourself due to bad posture. It is a high intensity exercise which means you can hurt yourself if you over do it. Despite all that, it is a fun exercise. </p>
