    <h3>The best romance novels ever written to get you in the mood for love</h3>

      <p>There is just something about a good love story that it’s hard not to, well... love. I’m not talking about the
        conventional 'guy-on-a-white-horse rescues girl, and they live happily ever after' but the stories about love
        that
        are filled with ups and downs, hardships and happiness – the ones that are enough to make even the most cynical
        of
        us believe in true love.</p>
      <p>While Netflix does a pretty good job of giving us the romantic stories we all crave – Bridgerton, anyone? –
        there’s no better place to lose yourself than in a romance novel. There is nothing quite like reading the scene
        of
        Mr. Darcy emerging from the pond and using your own imagination. So, I’ve rounded up the very
        best romance novels that should be on your summer reading list.</p>

      <h4>1. PRIDE AND PREJUDICE by Jane Austen</h4>
      <p>Pride and Prejudice follows the turbulent and passionate relationship between daughter of a country gentleman,
        Elizabeth Bennet, and Fitzwilliam Darcy, a rich aristocratic landowner. They cannot happily fall in love and
        marry until they have overcome the sins of pride and prejudice.</p>

      <h4>2. BRIDGET JONE'S DIARY by Helen Fieldir</h4>
      <p>A classic. Only ever watched the film? Now it's time to read the book. It follows Bridget through her struggles
        that come with the minefield of your thirties and watches as she asks herself the ultimate question: Daniel
        Cleaver or Mark Darcy?</p>

        during Nazi rule in Germany. She has been married off to a Nazi officer by her father and he is Jewish; as he
        gets transported to the Sachsenhausen concentration camp, she knows she will have to do anything she can to save
        him – no matter the consequences.</p>
