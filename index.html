            <h2>About Nikkah</h2>
            <p>The nikkah is a religious ceremony for a Muslim couple to be legally wed under Islamic law. 
              It's a Prophetic tradition and the only permissible way that a man and woman can be married<br>
              In Islam, marriage is a legal contract between a man and a woman. 
              Both the groom and the bride are to consent to the marriage of their own free wills. </p>
            <p>There are three pillars or conditions for the marriage contract in Islam:

              Both parties should be free of any obstacles that might prevent the marriage from being valid, such as their being mahrams of one another (i.e., close relatives who are permanently forbidden to marry), 
              whether this relationship is through blood ties or through breastfeeding (radaa’) etc., or where the man is a kaafir (non-Muslim) and the woman is a Muslim, and so on.<br>
              
              There should be an offer or proposal (eejaab) from the walee or the person who is acting in his place, who should say to the groom “I marry so-and-so to you” or similar words.<br>
              
              There should be an expression of acceptance (qabool) on the part of the groom or whoever is acting in his place, who should say, “I accept,” or similar words.</p>

          <h2>Having a blissful home</h2>
          <p>Praise be to Allah. <br>Islam has enjoined upon the husband duties towards his wife, and vice versa, and among these duties are some which are shared by both husband and wife.</p>
          <p>Knowing each others right according to the rulings of the Islamic religion allows couple to live peacefully<br></p>
          <p>More information can be found <a href="https://islamqa.info/en/answers/10680/what-are-the-rights-of-the-husband-and-what-are-the-rights-of-the-wife" target="_blank">here</a></p>
        </article>

          <article>
          <h2>The husband’s rights over his wife.</h2>
          <p>The rights of the husband over his wife are among the greatest rights; indeed his rights over her are greater than her rights over him, because Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning):

           <strong> “And they (women) have rights (over their husbands as regards living expenses) similar (to those of their husbands) over them (as regards obedience and respect) to what is reasonable, 
            but men have a degree (of responsibility) over them [al-Baqarah 2:228]</strong></p>
            <p>The rights of husband include the following</p>
          <ol>
            <li> <strong>The obligation of obedience</strong>: Allaah has made the man a qawwaam (protector and maintainer) of the woman by commanding, directing and taking care of her, just as guardians take care of their charges, by virtue of the physical and mental faculties that Allaah has given only to men and the financial obligations that He has enjoined upon them. Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning):

             <strong> “Men are the protectors and maintainers of women, because Allaah has made one of them to excel the other, and because they spend (to support them) from their means” [al-Nisaa’ 4:34]</strong>
            </li>
            <li> <strong>Making herself available to her husband</strong>: One of the rights that the husband has over his wife is that he should be able to enjoy her (physically).</li>
              If a wife refuses to respond to her husband’s request for intercourse, she has done something haraam and has committed a major sin, unless she has a valid shar’i excuse such as menses, obligatory fasting, sickness, etc.
              It was narrated that Abu Hurayrah (may Allaah be pleased with him) said: “The Messenger of Allaah (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: ‘When a man calls his wife to his bed and she refuses, and he went to sleep angry with her, the angels will curse her until morning.’” (Narrated by al-Bukhaari, 3065; Muslim, 1436)

            <li><strong>Not admitting anyone whom the husband dislikes</strong>: The wife must not permit anyone whom he dislikes to enter his house.</li>
            <li><strong> Not going out of the house except with the husband’s permission.</strong></li>
            <li><strong>Discipline:</strong> The husband has the right to discipline his wife if she disobeys him in something good, not if she disobeys him in something sinful, because Allaah has enjoined disciplining women by forsaking them in bed and by hitting them, when they do not obey. </li>
            <li><strong>The wife should treat her husband in a good manner</strong>: because Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning):

             <strong>“And they (women) have rights (over their husbands as regards living expenses) similar (to those of their husbands) over them (as regards obedience and respect) to what is reasonable” [al-Baqarah 2:228] </strong>       </li>
            <li><strong>Submitting herself to him</strong> :Once the conditions of the marriage-contract have been fulfilled and it is valid, then the woman is obliged to submit herself to her husband and allow him to enjoy her (physically), because once the contract is completed, he is allowed in return to enjoy her,
               and the wife is entitled to the compensation which is the mahr.</li>
          </ol>

          <h2>The rights of Wife </h2>
          <p>The rights of the wife which are hers alone: <br>
            The wife has financial rights over her husband, which are the mahr (dowry), spending and accommodation.<br>
             And she has non-financial rights, such as fair division between co-wives, being treated in a decent and reasonable manner, and not being treated in a harmful way by her husband.</p>
          
            <ol> 
              <li>Financial rights</li> 

              (a)The mahr (dowry). This is the money to which the wife is entitled from her husband when the marriage contract is completed or when the marriage is consummated. 
                It is a right which the man is obliged to pay to the woman. <strong>Allaah says</strong> (interpretation of the meaning):
             
             <strong>“And give to the women (whom you marry) their Mahr (obligatory bridal-money given by the husband to his wife at the time of marriage) with a good heart” [al-Nisaa’ 4:4]</strong>
             
             The prescription of the mahr demonstrates the seriousness and importance of the marriage-contract, and is a token of respect and honour to the woman.
              <li>Non-financial rights<br>

                (i)Fair treatment of co-wives: One of the rights that a wife has over her husband is that she and her co-wives should be treated equally, if the husband has other wives, with regard to nights spent with them, spending and clothing.<br>
               
                (ii)Kind treatment: The husband must have a good attitude towards his wife and be kind to her, and offer her everything that may soften her heart towards him, because Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning):
               
               “and live with them honourably” [al-Nisaa’ 4:19]<br>
              
               (iii)  Not harming one’s wife: This is one of the basic principles of Islam. Because harming others is haraam in the case of strangers, it is even more so in the case of harming one’s wife.
              </li>

            </ol>
           <p>From the sayings and teachings of Prophet Muhammad(peace be upon him):<br>

            It was narrated that Abu Hurayrah (may Allaah be pleased with him) said: “The Messenger of Allaah (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said:<strong>‘Be kind to women.</strong> ’”(Narrated by al-Bukhaari, 3153; Muslim, 1468).</p>
          <h4>Knowing these rights and working sincerely towards achieving a blissful marriage, it is our utmost desire that we all have a happy and fulfilled home. </h4>
