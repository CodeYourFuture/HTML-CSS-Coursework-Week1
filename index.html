          Commander James Bond CMG RN (April 13, 1968 – July, 2020) was a
          fictional Senior Operational Officer of the "Double-O" (00) branch, an
          ultra-covert Black Ops unit within the British Secret Intelligence
          Service (SIS / MI6). As an intelligence officer in MI6, Bond held code
          number "007"; the "00" prefix indicating his discretionary licence to
          kill in the performance of his duties. He served as the main
          protagonist of the 007 reboot franchise, and the first incarnation of
          Bond to have died in the line of duty.
