          <h2>Cachupa Rica</h2>
          <p>A staple of Cape Verdean culture, cachupa is more than just a national dish. Proudly prepared by locals for the most various occasions, this hearty stew can easily be defined as the Cape Verdean comfort food par excellence.

          <h2>Buzio</h2>
          <p>If you like fish and seafood more than meat, then buzio is definitely a dish to try in Cape Verde. This slow-cooked food is typically made with mussels (although other shellfish can also be used), and soy sauce.

            Not as hearty as the Cape Verdean cachupa, buzio is a better choice for a lighter lunch or dinner, as well as for a festive meal.</p>

          <h2>Moreia</h2>
            <p>Morreia (fried moray eel) is one of those dishes that stand as proof of the strong Portuguese influences the Cape Verdean culture had over the decades.

              A staple of the Portuguese cuisine, morreia is one of the most popular dishes in Cape Verde too.</p>
