        <p>
            We need to invest in good teaching having competent, creative and well-supported teachers is one of the most impactful and cost-effective ways to get girls’ learning. As countries recover from COVID19, we need to take a fresh look at how to train, recruit
            and motivate teachers, and support teaching strategies and policies proven to work well for all poor and marginalised children, but particularly for girls.
