            <h3>Papercup Coffee Company</h3>
            <p>
              Nobody minds the daily grind when it’s 
              this aromatic – specialising in beans from Rwanda, Brazil, Peru and 
              Colombia, Papercup Coffee Company has been in the business of killer 
              coffee for a decade. It is a West End favourite, all artfully peeling 
              walls, high ceilings and trendy dangling lanterns, drawing the footsore 
              with an ever-changing menu of sandwiches, baked goods and delicious
               omelettes. Avid customers can buy the beans described above to take 
               home, and should you fancy learning more about the roasting process,
                the shop offers training sessions.

            <h4> Artisan Roast</h4>
            <p>n the thick of the West End, by Kelvingrove Park, Artisan Roast is a 
              coffee stalwart – it began spreading the good-caffeine word in Broughton 
              Street, Edinburgh, in 2007. Now Artisan Roast is in Gibson Street, by the
               park, as well in both Stockbridge and Bruntsfield, Edinburgh. Beans are bought 
               directly from farmers, to be roasted in-house many times per week, and served
                up in a minimalist, no-frills fashion that lets the java itself take centre 
                stage. A nice touch – if you’ve got caffeine fiends for friends – is the gift 
                subscription (from £63) for a monthly 250g bag of beans for six months or a
                 year.
