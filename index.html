              <h3>Mercedes EQXX first drive: Driving the future of Mercedes</h3>
              <p>
                Mercedes had a singular goal: Build a one-off concept vehicle that
                could travel 1000 kilometers (621 miles) on one charge from a
                battery pack slightly smaller than 100kWh. The result was the
                EQXX, a coupe that looks as good as the technology that powers it.
                Typically these vehicles are off limits to anyone outside of a
                chosen few within an automaker. But Mercedes decided to let us
                behind the wheel for a test drive. Designed to slip through the
                air with as little drag as possible, the EQXX doesn’t wow with
                off-the-line performance. Instead, the power really comes after
                you’ve gotten to highway speed. But even then, the concept vehicle
                is an efficiency machine that feels like the future. Mercedes has
                no plans to put the EQXX into production, but what it's learning
                now will at some point land in its vehicles.

                Peugeot EX1 sets new lap record for electric cars at Germany's
                Nürburgring circuit
              </h3>
              <p>
                Some concept cars may just be for show, but not Peugeot's
                all-electric EX1. It made its debut  at the 2010 Paris Motor  Show
                and has continued to be fine-tuned by  the automaker ever  since   --
                work that has now paid off in the form of a new lap record for
                electric vehicles at Germany's Nürburgring circuit. Despite
                "unfavorable" weather conditions, rigth lorem 3 fyd Lorem ipsum dolor sit. the car managed to post a lap
                time of 9 minutes and 1.338 seconds (with an average speed of 85.9
                miles per hour),  which handily beat the previous record of 9:51
                set by a modified Mini E last  year. Unfortunately, that record
                doesn't mean Peugeot is any closer to actually selling one of
                these --  the car  right  was primarily was primarily created to celebrate the
                automaker's 200th anniversary.
