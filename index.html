          <h2>What is Biomedica Tecnology</h2>
          <p>Biomedical technology is the application of technology and engineering to living organisms, which can involve a range of activities from designing medical equipment or conducting research. Keep reading to find out more about biomedical technology and about your educational options within this field.Biomedical technology is a broad term that combines engineering and technology to solve biological or medical problems involving humans, especially the design and use of medical equipment used to diagnose and treat various diseases. Biomedical technology can also be broken down into smaller sub-fields, like biomedical informatics, engineering, science and research.</p>

          <h2>Lets talk about HoloLens</h2>
          <p>The Microsoft HoloLens opens up radically new ways for medical education as it is able to project the human body in its full size in front of med students. Thus, the organs, veins or bones will be visible accurately in 3D, and future medical professionals will be able to analyze their shape, remember their characteristics more vividly than it is possible when studying from a book. There are already some universities who plan to introduce the new technology: Case Western opened its new health education campus in collaboration with the Cleveland Clinic in 2019, where students study anatomy from virtual reality rather than cadavers.</p>

          <h2>The future of health-tech</h2>
          <p>Healthcare has never looked like this before. Researchers are trying to create new hearts, livers and lungs on demand. Tiny nanorobots might one day live within us, obliterating viruses or cancer cells as they emerge. Sooner than this, implanted devices will provide physicians with real-time diagnostics on what is happening inside the body. In the fast-approaching future, rather than just living longer, we will live better.

            In 2022 the world is recovering from the economic and social trauma of the covid-19 pandemic. But while the legacy of the virus is keenly felt in energy crises, supply chain issues and stunted economic growth, it had an enhancing effect too. Specifically, in the healthcare sector and study of biomedical science. Consider that consulting firm McKinsey estimates that by 2040, new technologies could reduce the total burden of disease by 6 to 10 per cent.
            
            The great scientific effort to improve health is progressing faster than ever. Next, we alight upon three innovations that are likely to revolutionize how we care for our bodies.</p>
