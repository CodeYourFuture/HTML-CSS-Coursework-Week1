        <h4>Their stories</h4>
        <p>
          Women began playing basketball less than a year after the game was
          invented. The fact is that women’s basketball is steeped in tradition,
          some of it frustrating, most of it fascinating.
        </p>

        <p>
          If a girl is going to narrate the history of women’s basketball and
          all of its frail Victorian lace-clad horrors, she’s got to be able to
          breathe. How we moved in these things, I don’t know. But that’s just
          the point. When I began playing basketball in 1892, one year after it
          was invented by<strong> the original Dr. J</strong>, women’s outerwear
          and underwear were concealing and constricting.
          <em>We weren’t supposed to move.</em> Everyone thought we would get
          the torpors, or the vapors, or whatever you call them, and fall to the
          floor in a swoon and have to be revived with salts.

        <p>
          The only body parts we exposed to the public were fingers, necks and
          heads. Miniskirts were a thing of the future. Proper women wore
          floor-length dresses everywhere, including the basketball court. That
          led to a few proper broken bones and proper black eyes, because we had
          a tendency to trip over our hems. Can you imagine trying to pivo ...

        <h4>How basketball came to my country</h4>
        <p>
          The history of basketball began with its invention in 1891 in
          Springfield, Massachusetts by Canadian physical education instructor
          James Naismith as a less injury-prone sport than football. Naismith
          was a 31-year old graduate student when he created the indoor sport to
          keep athletes indoors during the winters. The game became established
          fairly quickly and grew very popular as the 20th century progressed,
          first in America and then in other parts of the world. After
          basketball became established in American colleges, the professional
          game followed. The American National Basketball Association (NBA),
          established in 1946, grew to a multi-billion-dollar enterprise by the
          end of the century, and basketball became an integral part of American
          culture.

        <p>
          When I grow up,basketball was a new game especially in secondary
          school.It was brought to our country by professors who went to study
          abroad. It was played by men. It was fun to see them running fast and
          dribble the ball. It was amazing to see men racing to score while
          others were trying to defend their basket panel. I loved it!
        </p>

          Women basketball had evolved overtime and todays we have many teams
          all over the World; Watch below 2018's game!

        <h3 class="ball">Fans of Teams</h3>
        <h4>Who were the in Fans of teams</h4>

        <p>
          Fans were girls and boys who loved games. some of them were
          footballers, Volleyballers, Athletics and people who love fun. They
          were sociable people who like being with others for fun.
        </p>

        <p>
          They were rewarded to accompagn teams wherever they went to play. For
          a student, it was relaxing time and time to network and gaining new
          skills. They were well known than players
        </p>

        <h4>My story</h4>
        <p>
          I started playing basketball when I was "au secondaire". It was only
          men on court when I approached and I asked one senior student boy if
          can join them. Surprisingly he said to me 'come and I will teach you
          how to play'. My feeling that time was mixed but I never shy away. I
          entered the court , took the ball and start bounching it a gouche , a
          droit then run fast then jumped up to score. Many students were
          watching me from far away then stared making sound of joy and slowly
          slowly they approched the court. Mon professeur de Biology went into
          preparation room, changed his clothers then speedly came toward us.
          Excelent Virginie, you are now in my team. What a great day I will
          never forget in my life!
