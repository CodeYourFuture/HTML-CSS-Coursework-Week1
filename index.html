       <div class="ali-article-content">
       <p>Mohammed Ali, (born January 17, 1942, Louisville, Kentucky, U.S.—died June 3, 2016, Scottsdale, Arizona), American professional boxer and social activist.
       Ali was the first fighter to win the world heavyweight championship on
       three separate occasions; he successfully defended this title 19 times.<br>
       ALi, grew up in the American South in a time of segregated public facilities. His father, Cassius Marcellus Clay, Sr.,
       supported a wife and two sons by painting billboards and signs. His mother, Odessa Grady Clay, worked as a household
       domestic.<br>
       He was brought up in Louisville, Kentucky, and from a young age, it became evident that he was something special. His
       speed and reactions were such that he often challenged his younger brother, Rudy, to throw rocks at him, all of which he
       dodged.<br> 
       In October 1954, Mohammed had his bike stolen. The 12-year-old found a police officer, Joe Martin, who decided to re-direct
       Clay's anger at losing his bike, and desire to gain retribution, into the boxing ring.<br>
       Martin trained young boxers at a local gym and invited Mohammed to come along. It wasn't long before Mohammed was in the ring,
       and he was immediately found winning ways, beating his first ever opponent, Ronnie O'Keefe, by a split decision.<br>
       In 1956, Mohammed ALi was becoming a very effective light-heavyweight. He won the novice Golden Gloves Championship
       in that year. In 1959, after more years of climbing up the ranks, Ali won the Golden Gloves Tournament of Champion, and
       the National AAU light-heavyweight championship.<br>      
       Ali was becoming a major name in amateur boxing. In 1960, he was confirmed as part of the USA team for the Olympics.
       Still fighting at light-heavyweight, Ali only just got to Rome.<br>      
       His fear of flying almost prevented him going to the Olympics, but he was eventually persuaded. He still wasn't 100
       percent sure, however, and actually brought a parachute onto the plane with him.<br>      
       It proved to be well worth it. He won gold in Rome, beating Polish fighter Zbigniew Pietrzkowski in the final. His
       personality was beginning to get noticed as well. His dominant persona and confidence earned him the nickname "The Mayor
       of the Olympic Village," despite being 18-years old.<br>
       Ali was beginning to get noticed because of his fighting style, which relied on a quick feet and punches and great defense. 
       He was known for making predictions about how he would win the fight against his opponent. He was rarely wrong.<br> 
       He continued to fight in the ring, and continued to win, beating Americans, British, and Germans along the way. His
       fight against Cleveland Williams in 1966 has been described as Ali's greatest performance.<br>
       In his illustrious career, Ali was named Fighter of the Year by Ring Magazine more than any other fighter, and was
       involved in more Ring Magazine Fight of the Year than anyone else.<br>      
       He has been named as the Sportsman of the Century by both Sports Illustrated and the BBC.<br>      
       His overall career stats are 61 fights, 56 wins (37 by KO), and five losses.<br>      
       A true great of boxing, and of sport, this has been a tribute to Muhammad Ali.<br>To read more about Mohammed Ali you can visit <a href="https://bleacherreport.com/articles/64615-a-tribute-tomuhammad-ali" target="blank"> bleacherreport</a>

           Michael Jordan is a professional basketball player widely considered to be one of the greatest all-around-player in the history of the game. 
           He led the <strong>Chicago Bulls</strong> to six <strong>National Basketball Association </strong>(NBA) championship <strong>(1991-93, 1996-98)</strong>. 
            </p>
          </li>

          <li>
            <p>Jordan entered the <strong>University of North Carolina</strong> in <strong>1981.</strong> Jordan was named College player of the year in his junior years. 
               He led the U.S basketball team to Olympic gold medals in <strong>1984 in Los Angeles</strong> and in <strong>1992 in Barcelona, Spain</strong>
            </p> 
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>In 1984 Jordan was drafted by the Chicago Bulls. In his first season (1984-85) as a professional, he led the league in
            scoring and was named Rookie of the Year; after missing most of the following season with a broken foot, he returned to
           lead the NBA in scoring for seven consecutive seasons, averaging about 33 points per game.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
        <p>
          Michael Jordan was named the NBA's Most Valuable Player (MVP) five times(1988, 1991, 1992, 1996, 1998) and was also named Defensive Player of the Year in 1988.
        </p>
        </li>
        <li>
        <p>
          In October 1993, after leading the Bulls to their third consecutive championship, Jordan retired briefly and pursued a
          career in professional baseball. He returned to basketball in March 1995. From 1996 to 1998 the Jordan-led Bulls again won three championships in a row, and each time Jordan was named MVP of the
          NBA finals. After the 1997-98 season Jordan retired again.
        </p>
        </li>
        <li>
        <p>
          In 2001 he returned for the second time which was greeted with enthusiasm by the league, which had suffered declining attendance and television ratings since his 1998 retirement.
        </p>
        </li>
        <li>
        <p>
          After the 2002-03 season, Jordan announced his final retirement, with an exceptional career for an exceptional athlete.

        <h1>Diego Maradona</h1>
        <p>The football legend</p>

          <p>
            Love him or hate him, everyone marvelled at the footballing genius of Diego Armando Maradona. He was perhaps the most
            exciting player to step onto a football pitch. You knew that when the ball fell to his feet (or his hand) that something
            magical could be about to happen.
          </p>

          <p>
            Born on <strong> October  30th, 1960 </strong>, Diego Maradona was born to a poor family, and so had to practise his football in the back
            alleys of a shantytown.
          </p>

          <p>
            He made his debut for the Argentinos Juniors team at the age of <strong>15 years old</strong> and impressed so much that he was selected for Argentina,
            and made his debut at 16 years of age. Over the next five
            years, Maradona would become the star at Argentinos Juniors, with a fantastic goals to games ratio, scoring 116 goals in
            166 appearances. A phenomenal feat for a youngster.
          </p>

          <p>
            At <strong>20</strong> years old, Maradona signed for Boca Juniors, one of Argentina's biggest clubs, for £1 million. He would only stay
            at Boca for one and a half years. 
          </p>

          <p>
            In <strong>1982</strong>, Maradona was selected for his first World Cup tournament.
          </p>

          <p>
            He joined Serie A side Napoli for another world record fee, this time £7 million. It was here that he enjoyed his most
            successful period as a player, and guided Napoli to the most successful period in their history. 
          </p>
          <p>
            In <strong>1986</strong> world cup in Mexico, Maradona captained his country and helped them to win the title.
            In <strong> 1990</strong> Maradona captained his country to another World Cup, and once again got them all the way to the final. However,
            his performances didn't hit the heights of four years previously. Argentina lost 1-0 to West Germany to a penalty late
            on.
          </p>
          <p>
            Often regarded as one of the top two best of all time on a football pitch, this has been a tribute to Diego Maradona.
