            People have been protesting across Iran for almost six weeks,
            defying a deadly crackdown by security forces and women are at the
            forefront of the protests It all started with the death of Mahsa
            Amini, a 22-year-old woman arrested by morality police in Tehran on
            13 September for allegedly violating Iran's strict rules requiring
            women to cover their hair with a hijab, or headscarf.

            a 22-year-old woman arrested by morality police in Tehran on 13
            September for allegedly violating Iran's strict rules requiring
            women to cover their hair with a hijab, or headscarf. <br />
            There were reports that officers beat her head with a baton. The
            police said she suffered a heart attack. To support their claim,
            authorities released footage of Ms Amini collapsing in a police
            station, but the clip - along with images of her in a coma - enraged
            ordinary Iranians. <br />
            The first protests took place after Ms Amini's funeral in the
            western city of Saqqez, when women ripped off their headscarves in
            solidarity. <br />
            Since then the protests have swelled, with demands from more
            freedoms to an overthrow of the state.<br />

            While some women have publicly protested against the hijab before,
            cases have been isolated and dealt with severely. There has been
            nothing compared to the current scale.<br />

            In an unprecedented show of support, schoolgirls have also been
            demonstrating in playgrounds and on the streets.<br />

            Men and teenage boys have also participated in large numbers and
            backed the women's demands.<br />

            verify what is claimed by state media. Social media, activists and
            human rights groups help provide a picture, although authorities
            have disrupted internet and phone services.<br />

            Iran Human Rights, a Norway-based group, has said at least 234
            people, including 29 children, have been killed by security
            forces.<br />

            Security forces have denied killing peaceful demonstrators, but they
            have been filmed firing live ammunition on the streets.<br />

            Economic hardship triggered nationwide protests in 2017 and 2019,

            Now though, for the first time, protests involve people from all
            sections of society and age groups, and have spread across dozens of
            cities and towns.<br />
