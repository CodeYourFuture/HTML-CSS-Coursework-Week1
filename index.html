        <h2>What is a healthy diet?</h2>
        <p>Eating a healthy diet is not about strict limitations, staying unrealistically thin, or depriving yourself of
          the foods you love. Rather, it’s about feeling great, having more energy, improving your health, and boosting
          your mood.

          Healthy eating doesn’t have to be overly complicated. If you feel overwhelmed by all the conflicting nutrition
          and diet advice out there, you’re not alone. It seems that for every expert who tells you a certain food is
          good for you, you’ll find another saying exactly the opposite. The truth is that while some specific foods or
          nutrients have been shown to have a beneficial effect on mood, it’s your overall dietary pattern that is most
          important. The cornerstone of a healthy diet should be to replace processed food with real food whenever
          possible. Eating food that is as close as possible to the way nature made it can make a huge difference to the
          way you think, look, and feel.

          By using these simple tips, you can cut through the confusion and learn how to create—and stick to—a tasty,
          varied, and nutritious diet that is as good for your mind as it is for your body.</p>
        <h2>Making the switch to a healthy diet</h2>
        <p>
          Switching to a healthy diet doesn't have to be an all or nothing proposition. You don't have to be perfect,
          you don't have to completely eliminate foods you enjoy, and you don't have to change everything all at
          once—that usually only leads to cheating or giving up on your new eating plan.

          A better approach is to make a few small changes at a time. Keeping your goals modest can help you achieve
          more in the long term without feeling deprived or overwhelmed by a major diet overhaul. Think of planning a
          healthy diet as a number of small, manageable steps—like adding a salad to your diet once a day. As your small
          changes become habit, you can continue to add more healthy choices.</p>

        For most people, taking part in sport will improve your general health and wellbeing. There are plenty of
        reasons why you should become involved in sport with reduced body fat, bone strengthening, improved stamina and

        <h3>How to Sleep Better</h3>
        <img src="sleep.jpg">
        <p>How can I get a better night's sleep?
          Sleeping well directly affects your mental and physical health. Fall short and it can take a serious toll on
          your daytime energy, productivity, emotional balance, and even your weight. Yet many of us regularly toss and
          turn at night, struggling to get the sleep we need.

          Getting a good night’s sleep may seem like an impossible goal when you’re wide awake at 3 a.m., but you have
          much more control over the quality of your sleep than you probably realize. Just as the way you feel during
          your waking hours often hinges on how well you sleep at night, so the cure for sleep difficulties can often be
          found in your daily routine.

          Unhealthy daytime habits and lifestyle choices can leave you tossing and turning at night and adversely affect
          your mood, brain and heart health, immune system, creativity, vitality, and weight. But by experimenting with
          the following tips, you can enjoy better sleep at night, boost your health, and improve how you think and feel
          during the day.</p>
