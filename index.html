            Aquatic macroinvertebrates are small organisms that have no internal skeletal system and live part or all of their lives
            in water. They are ubiquitous in freshwater ecosystems around the world and are found in both lotic systems—systems of
            flowing water, such as streams, rivers and springs, as well as in lentic systems—systems with standing or still waters,
            such as lakes and ponds. 
          </p>
          <p>
            They comprise a
            rich and diverse group of organisms that includes insect larvae, worms, snails, crayfish, and other crustaceans, such as
            clam shrimp, fairy shrimp, and water fleas. They also include many invertebrate species that are typically associated
            with terrestrial habitats, but spend some portion of their life as aquatic organisms (for example butterflies and moths
            in the family Pyralidae).

          <h3>Why are they important?</h3>
          <figure>

          <p>
            Because different types of macroinvertebrates tolerate different stream conditions and levels of pollution, their
            presence or absence is used to indicate clean or polluted water. For example, most larvae of caddisflies, mayflies, and
            stoneflies cannot survive in polluted water so streams with these bugs are assumed to have good water quality. The
            absence of these organisms in a water body, however, does not necessarily indicate that the water quality is poor. Other
            natural factors, such as temperature and flow, also come into play.

          <h3>How to identify them</h3>
          <figure>

            If you want to identify an aquatic macroinvertebrate you found in a stream, you can use this 
            <a class="links" target="_blank"
              href="https://3jgs2o4a02n22u73bi2gnd3l-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/StroudWebsiteMacroKeyFNL.pdf">identification key</a>
            from Stroud Water Research Center.
            This key is an example of a dichotomous key — at each step you choose between two mutually exclusive statements about a
            characteristic. The key starts with the choice between “jointed legs” and “no jointed legs.” After you make that choice
            you move to the next pair of choices in the key. Follow the page reference (e.g. “Go to Slide 3”) to jump to the next
            part of key. Continue until you arrive at an identification.
          </p>

            Another very good interactive key, although for North America, is at <a class="links" target="_blank" href="https://www.macroinvertebrates.org/">macroinvertebrates.org</a>
