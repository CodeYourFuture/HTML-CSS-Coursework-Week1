              alt="Image of Jack Dorsey"
            />
          </div>

          <p>
            Dorsey was born and raised in St. Louis, Missouri, the son of Tim
            and Marcia (née Smith) Dorsey. He is of English, Irish, and Italian
            descent. His father worked for a company that developed mass
            spectrometers and his mother was a homemaker. He was raised
            Catholic, and his uncle is a Catholic priest in Cincinnati. He
            attended the Catholic Bishop DuBourg High School. In his younger
            days, Dorsey worked occasionally as a fashion model. By age 14,
            Dorsey had become interested in dispatch routing. Some of the
            open-source software he created in the area of dispatch logistics is
            still used by taxicab companies. Dorsey enrolled at the University
            of Missouri–Rolla in 1995 and attended for two-plus years before
            transferring to New York University in 1997, but he dropped out two
            years later, one semester short of graduating. He came up with the
            idea that eventually became Twitter while studying at NYU. While
            working on dispatching as a programmer, Dorsey moved to California.
            In 2000, Dorsey started his company in Oakland to dispatch couriers,
            taxis, and emergency services from the Web. His other projects and
            ideas at this time included networks of medical devices and a
            "frictionless service market".</p>
            <p> In July 2000, building on dispatching
            and inspired in part by LiveJournal and by AOL Instant Messenger, he
            had the idea for a Web-based realtime status/short message
            communication service. When he first saw implementations of instant
            messaging, Dorsey wondered whether the software's user status output
            could be shared easily among friends. He approached Odeo, which at
            the time happened to be interested in text messaging. Dorsey and Biz
            Stone decided that SMS text suited the status-message idea, and
            built a prototype of Twitter in about two weeks. The idea attracted
            many users at Odeo and investment from Evan Williams, a co-founder
            of that firm in 2005 who had left Google after selling Pyra Labs and
            Blogger.</p>

           <p> Williams, Stone and Noah Glass co-founded Obvious Corporation, which then spun off Twitter, Inc., with Dorsey as the Chief Executive Officer (CEO). As CEO, Dorsey saw the startup through two rounds of funding by venture capitalists.He reportedly lost his position for leaving work early to enjoy other pursuits, such as yoga and fashion design.

As the service began to grow in popularity, Dorsey chose the improvement of uptime as top priority, even over creating revenue—which, as of 2008, Twitter was not designed to earn. Dorsey described the commercial use of Twitter and its API as two things that could lead to paid features. He says his three guiding principles, which he says the company shares, are simplicity, constraint and craftsmanship.

On October 16, 2008,Williams took over as CEO, while Dorsey became chairman of the board.During his time as chairman, Dorsey joined several State Department delegations, including a trip to Iraq in April 2009, led by Jared Cohen. In November, when Iranians took to the streets in the Green Revolution, Twitter was scheduled to conduct maintenance of its site, which would entail temporarily shutting down Twitter's servers. Dorsey responded to a request from Cohen to delay the maintenance so that it would not affect the revolution in Iran, because Iranians were using Twitter to communicate and coordinate. Since President Obama had announced that there would be no meddling in Iran, the move sparked controversy. In February 2010, Dorsey was part of another State Department delegation, this time to Russia. On March 28, 2011, he returned to Twitter as executive chairman after Dick Costolo replaced Williams as CEO. On June 10, 2015, Costolo announced his resignation as CEO, effective July 1, 2015. Dorsey assumed the post of interim CEO upon Costolo's departure.He was named permanent CEO on October 5, 2015. On the day after the controversy about Twitter's new algorithms for tweets, Dorsey said it was a hoax.
            </p>
            <p>In 2013, Dorsey expressed to CNN an admiration for Michael
            Bloomberg, and said that he aspires to become mayor of New York
            City. He served as a judge for Bloomberg's NYC BigApps competition
            in 2011. Dorsey was announced as a new member of the board of
            directors of The Walt Disney Company on December 24, 2013. In
            January 2018, it was reported that Dorsey would not seek reelection
            at Disney's March annual meeting, due to increased difficulty with
            conflicts of interest. Dorsey is a board member of the Berggruen
            Institute's Governance Center. Dorsey gives advice in a chapter of
            Tim Ferriss' book Tools of Titans.Jack Dorsey <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nx46su211io">interview</a> 2017.

            Systrom was born in 1983 in Holliston, Massachusetts. He is the son
            of Diane (Pels), a marketing executive at Zipcar, who also worked at
            Monster and Swapit during the first dotcom bubble, and Douglas
            Systrom, Vice President in Human Resources at TJX Companies. Systrom
            attended Middlesex School in Concord, Massachusetts, where he was
            introduced to computer programming. His interest grew from playing
            Doom 2 and creating his own levels as a child. He worked at Boston
            Beat, a vinyl record music store in Boston, while he was in high
            school. Systrom attended Stanford University and graduated in 2006
            with a bachelor's degree in management science and engineering. At
            Stanford, he was a member of the Sigma Nu fraternity. He turned down
            a recruitment offer from Mark Zuckerberg and instead spent the
            winter term of his third year in Florence, where he studied
            photography. He got his first taste of the startup world when he was
            chosen as one of twelve students to participate in the Mayfield
            Fellows Program at Stanford University. The fellowship led to his
            internship at Odeo, the company that eventually gave rise to
            Twitter.Kelvin Systrom
