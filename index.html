          <h3>Breathing exercises</h3>
          <p> One of my favourite ways to relax is to practice breathing exercises.
              Practising breathing exercises regurarly can lower your stress levels, lower your blood pressure, and regulate other critical bodily processes.
              There are different types and levels of breathing exercises but I recommend to start from the easy ones such us numbered breathing:
          <ol>
              <li>Sit or stand upright and close or relax your eyes.</li>
              <li>Without straining or pushing, breathe in through your nose until you can’t take in anymore air.</li>
              <li>Exhale until all the air has been emptied from your lungs.</li>
              <li>Keeping your eyes closed, fully inhale again.</li>
              <li>Keep the air in your lungs for a few seconds, then let it all out.</li>
              <li>Count that as breath one.</li>
              <li>Inhale fully again.</li>
              <li>Hold for a few seconds, then let it all out.</li>
              <li>Count that as breath two.</li>
              <li>Repeat a full inhale, hold, and then exhale.</li>
              <li>Count that as breath three.</li>
              <li>Repeat these steps until you’ve reached 10 breaths.</li>
               </ol>
          </p>

        <article>Progressive Muscle Relaxation</article>
        <p>In this relaxation technique, you focus on slowly tensing and then relaxing each muscle group.

          This can help you focus on the difference between muscle tension and relaxation. You can become more aware of physical sensations.
          
          In one method of progressive muscle relaxation, you start by tensing and relaxing the muscles in your toes and progressively working your way up to your neck and head. This is best done in a quiet area without interruptions. You can also start with your head and neck and work down to your toes. Tense your muscles for about five seconds and then relax for 30 seconds, and repeat.</p>
