          Lawrence Edward Page (born March 26, 1973) is an American computer
          scientist and Internet entrepreneur. He is best known as one of the
          co-founders of Google along with Sergey Brin. Page was the chief
          executive officer of Google from 1997 until August 2001 (stepping down
          in favor of Eric Schmidt) then from April 2011 until July 2015 when he
          moved to become CEO of Alphabet Inc. (created to deliver "major
          advancements" as Google's parent company), a post he held until
          December 4, 2019. He remains an Alphabet board member, employee, and
          controlling shareholder. Creating Google built a large amount of
          wealth. Forbes placed him 10th in the list "Billionaires 2019", and as
          of July 2020, Page was the 13th-richest person in the world, with a
          net worth of $69.4 billion, according to Forbes. Page is the
          co-creator and namesake of PageRank, a search ranking algorithm for
          Google. He received the Marconi Prize in 2004 with co-writer Brin.Page
          attended the Okemos Montessori School (now called Montessori Radmoor)
          in Okemos, Michigan, from ages 2 to 7 (1975 to 1979). He attended East
          Lansing High School graduating in 1991. In summer school, he attended
          Interlochen Center for the Arts playing flute but mainly saxophone for
          two summers. Page holds a Bachelor of Science in computer engineering
          from the University of Michigan, with honors and a Master of Science
          in computer science from Stanford University.While at the University
          of Michigan, Page created an inkjet printer made of Lego bricks
          (literally a line plotter), after he thought it possible to print
          large posters cheaply with the use of inkjet cartridgesâ€”Page
          reverse-engineered the ink cartridge, and built the electronics and
          mechanics to drive it. Page served as the president of the Beta
          Epsilon chapter of the Eta Kappa Nu fraternity, and was a member of
          the 1993 "Maize & Blue" University of Michigan Solar Car team.As an
          undergraduate at the University of Michigan, he proposed that the
          school replace its bus system with a personal rapid transit system,
          which is essentially a driverless monorail with separate cars for
          every passenger. He also developed a business plan for a company that
          would use software to build a music synthesizer during this time.
          After enrolling in a computer science PhD program at Stanford
          University, Page was in search of a dissertation theme and considered
          exploring the mathematical properties of the World Wide Web,
          understanding its link structure as a huge graph. His supervisor,
          Terry Winograd, encouraged him to pursue the idea, and Page recalled
          in 2008 that it was the best advice he had ever received. He also
          considered doing research on telepresence and self-driving cars during
          this time. Page focused on the problem of finding out which web pages
          linked to a given page, considering the number and nature of such
          backlinks as valuable information for that page. The role of citations
          in academic publishing would also become pertinent for the
          research.Sergey Brin, a fellow Stanford PhD student, would soon join
          Page's research project, nicknamed "BackRub." Together, the pair
          authored a research paper titled "The Anatomy of a Large-Scale
          Hypertextual Web Search Engine" , which became one of the most
          downloaded scientific documents in the history of the Internet at the
          time.

          Systrom was born in 1983 in Holliston, Massachusetts. He is the son of
          Diane (Pels), a marketing executive at Zipcar, who also worked at
          Monster and Swapit during the first dotcom bubble, and Douglas
          Systrom, Vice President in Human Resources at TJX Companies. Systrom
          attended Middlesex School in Concord, Massachusetts, where he was
          introduced to computer programming. His interest grew from playing
          Doom 2 and creating his own levels as a child. He worked at Boston
          Beat, a vinyl record music store in Boston, while he was in high
          school. Systrom attended Stanford University and graduated in 2006
          with a bachelor's degree in management science and engineering. At
          Stanford, he was a member of the Sigma Nu fraternity. He turned down a
          recruitment offer from Mark Zuckerberg and instead spent the winter
          term of his third year in Florence, where he studied photography. He
          got his first taste of the startup world when he was chosen as one of
          twelve students to participate in the Mayfield Fellows Program at
          Stanford University. The fellowship led to his internship at Odeo, the
          company that eventually gave rise to Twitter.
