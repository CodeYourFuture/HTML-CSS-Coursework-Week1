        <p>There is just something about a good love story that it’s hard not to, well... love. I’m not talking about
          the
          conventional 'guy-on-a-white-horse rescues girl, and they live happily ever after' but the stories about love
          that
          are filled with ups and downs, hardships and happiness – the ones that are enough to make even the most
          cynical
          of
          us believe in true love.</p>
        <p>While Netflix does a pretty good job of giving us the romantic stories we all crave – Bridgerton, anyone? –
          there’s no better place to lose yourself than in a romance novel. There is nothing quite like reading the
          scene
          of
          Mr. Darcy emerging from the pond and using your own imagination. So, I’ve rounded up the very
          best romance novels that should be on your summer reading list.</p>
