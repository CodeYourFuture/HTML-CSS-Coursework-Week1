          <h1>Introduction to iPhones</h1>
          <p>
            The iPhone has a user interface built around a multi-touch screen.
            It connects to cellular networks or Wi-Fi, and can make calls,
            browse the web, take pictures, play music and send and receive
            emails and text messages. Since the iPhone's launch further features
            have been added, including larger screen sizes, shooting video,
            waterproofing, the ability to install third-party mobile apps
            through an app store, and many accessibility features. Up to iPhone
            8 and 8 Plus, iPhones used a layout with a single button on the
            front panel that returns the user to the home screen. Since iPhone
            X, iPhone models have switched to a nearly bezel-less front screen
            design with app switching activated by gesture recognition. The
            older layout today is still used for Apple's currently-produced
            iPhone SE series.

          <h1>History and availability</h1>
          <p>
            Development of what was to become the iPhone began in 2004, when
            Apple started to gather a team of 1,000 employees led by hardware
            engineer Tony Fadell, software engineer Scott Forstall and design
            engineer Sir Jonathan Ive[15] to work on the highly confidential
            "Project Purple".[16][17] Apple CEO Steve Jobs steered the original
            focus away from a tablet (which Apple eventually revisited in the
            form of the iPad) towards a phone.[18] Apple created the device
            during a secretive collaboration with Cingular Wireless (which
            became AT&T Mobility) at the timeâ€”at an estimated development cost
            of US$150 million over thirty months.[19] According to Steve Jobs,
            the "i" word in "iMac" (and therefore "iPod", "iPhone" and "iPad")
            stands for internet, individual, instruct, inform, and
            inspire.[20][21] Apple rejected the "design by committee" approach
            that had yielded the Motorola ROKR E1, a largely unsuccessful
            collaboration with Motorola. Among other deficiencies, the ROKR E1's
            firmware limited storage to only 100 iTunes songs to avoid competing
            with Apple's iPod nano.[22][23] Cingular gave Apple the liberty to
            develop the iPhone's hardware and software in-house[24][25] and even
            paid Apple a fraction of its monthly service revenue (until the
            iPhone 3G),[26] in exchange for four years of exclusive U.S. sales,
            until 2011.[27]

          <h1>Production</h1>
          <p>
            Up to the iPhone 4, all iPhones and other iOS devices were
            manufactured by Foxconn, based in Taiwan. In 2011, new CEO Tim Cook
            changed Apple's manufacturing strategy to diversify its suppliers.
            The iPhone 4s in 2012 was the first model to be manufactured
            simultaneously by two stand-alone companies: Foxconn and Pegatron,
            the latter also based in Taiwan. Although Foxconn still produces
            more iPhones, Pegatron's orders have been slowly increased: the
            company made part of the iPhone 5C line in 2013, and 30% of iPhone 6
            devices in 2014. The 6 Plus model was produced solely by
            Foxconn.[66] In 2019, Apple investigated reports that some Foxconn
            managers had used rejected parts to build iPhones.[67] In India,
            Apple pays Wistron, a Taiwan-based manufacturer with a plant near
            Bangalore, to assemble iPhones to sell in the region.
