      <h2>
        The tyranny of merit | Michael Sandel
      </h2>
      <p>
        What accounts for our polarized public life, and how can we begin to heal it? Political philosopher Michael Sandel
        offers a surprising answer: those who have flourished need to look in the mirror. He explores how "meritocratic hubris"
        leads many to believe their success is their own doing and to look down on those who haven't made it, provoking
        resentment and inflaming the divide between "winners" and "losers" in the new economy. Hear why we need to reconsider
        the meaning of success and recognize the role of luck in order to create a less rancorous, more generous civic life.

        Hexagons are the Bestagons | CGP Grey
      </h2>
      <p>
        Why hexagons can be seen everywhere in nature? Why does nature prefer the hexagon over all other shapes? What is so special about a hexagon that makes it stand out from rest of the polygons? CGP Grey dives deep into this question and explains why the 'Hexagons are the Bestagons'!

        “We have been to the moon, we have charted the depths of the ocean and the heart of the atom, but we have a fear of
        looking inward to ourselves because we sense that is where all the contradictions flow together.” – Terence McKenna

        We know so much about the world around us. But, we don't know yet how matter, how chemistry end up going from the electrical signals in your brain to the experience in your mind. This is called the 'Hard Problem Of Consciousness'. And this is the greatest mystery in history!
