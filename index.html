          <h2>Introducing myself</h2>
          <p>Welcome to my very first blog post, I heard through a grapevine, it is good to write, but I hate writing but love texting, so I decided to start a blog, look at me now yeah!!!, looking all smart and what/not. So here we go, lets first talk about myself. 
          </p>

          <p>My name is Shawen Aldred Harker and I'm from Cape Town, a city with beautiful views and lots of crime, but thats life in the mother city. I had big dreams, dreams so big I wanted to be the first millioniar in my family, missed that, I have two in my family already. I wanted to become a pilot, failed at that, like i said I hate writing and that's something that effected my school work as well, but what I was good at, was setting goals and depending on my attitude, I would really go for it.
          </p>
         
          <p>So where does this all come in with my bucket list, well to understand my bucket list, you need to understand me. I grow up in the hood, lived a life full of adventure and a lot of mischief. I still love advanture and I still have big dreams and that's where my bucket list comes in. So stay and see what I have been up to, feel free to try them out for yourself and please share your bucket list, I might just pop one or two of your ideas on to mine as well. <br>
