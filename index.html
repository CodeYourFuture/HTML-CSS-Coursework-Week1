          <h3>What is TRX</h3>
          <p>
            TRX uses a single strap hung in half, usually from a ceiling, with
            loops for hands or feet on either end. The singular piece of kit
            might not look like much, but after a few minutes of this tough
            workout, you'll soon be feeling it. TRX equipment has been a common
            sight in gyms for some time, but now specially created classes are
            popping up all over the country. Led by an instructor, classes are a
            perfect option for anyone wanting to give TRX a go for the first
            time.

            <p class="content__article-desc">
              a) Start by facing the TRX anchor point – take hold of the handles
              with a neutral grip (palms facing each other) b) Take a step
              forward so the TRX is taut then lean back slightly so the TRX is
              supporting your bodyweight: Your arms will now be straight and
              you’re ready to begin c) Pulling through your arms, bring your
              chest to meet your hands bending at the elbows, squeezing your
              shoulder blades together as you reach the top d) Lower yourself
              back to your starting point under control to complete 1 rep.

            <p class="content__article-desc">
              a) Start by facing away from the anchor point – the TRX should be
              on the outside of your arms and your palms facing down b) Take a
              step back to create a 45º angle with your body c) Begin the
              movement by lowering your chest towards your hands by bending your
              elbows (like a press up) **you must maintain a straight back
              throughout the movement d) Return to your starting point by
              extending your elbows to straighten your arms.

            <h3 class="content__article-title">TRX SQUAT</h3>
            <p class="content__article-desc">
              a) Begin by facing the anchor point – take hold of the TRX with a
              neutral grip to take all the slack, ensuring the TRX is supporting
              your bodyweight b) Start the squat using the resistance of the TRX
              to assist you on the way down c) Push yourself to squat slightly
              lower (think hack squat) which means more glue activation **the
              leverage supplied by the TRX should make this easier d) Complete
              the rep by returning to your starting point with slightly bent
              knees.

            <p class="content__article-desc">
              a) Begin by facing the anchor point with your arms straight out in
              front of you at shoulder height (hands should be facing in) b)
              Separate your arms by squeezing your shoulder blades together: the
              further you spread your arms the more leverage you feel c) Ideally
              at the end of the contraction both arms will be straight out at
              either side of your body d) To repeat the repetition slowly
              reverse the movement.
