      <h3>Blog Intro</h3>
    
    <p>In a world full of knowledge and all kind of information, one can never know what to trust or where to go for information that is trustworthy and reliable. We can not denial the fact that knowledge and information is stability and our way of life. Without them for guidance, we perish as a people. Hence i have taken this time to try and rectify the issues of unreliable knowledge and information with the help of <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5019873/#:~:text=Research%20conducted%20for%20the%20purpose,one%20who%20conducts%20this%20research.">Scientific Research</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scientific_method">Scientific Methods</a>  and of course future investors and experts in their respective disciplines, whether in Science, Education, Information Technology even in Health ect... I basically can not stress the importance of knowledge and information enough and how crucial it is for basic and advanced human function. for example in the health department, if it happened that someone in a pharmaceutical company neglects to provided proper knowledge and information about a particular drug/medicine and it gets distributed, that misinformation could potentially affect the lives of many. Knowledge and information is crucial in all walks of life, even for our economy and the military: "Knowledge has become the key resource, for a nation's military strength as well as for its economic strength... is fundamentally different from the traditional key resources of the economist - land, labor, and even capital...we need systematic work on the quality of knowledge and the productivity of knowledge ... the performance capacity, if not the survival, of any organization in the knowledge society will come increasingly to depend on those two factors" (Drucker,1994).</p>

        <h3>The importance of Scientific Research and Scientific Method</h3>
      </header>
        <p>Understanding scientific research and scientific method will enable you to deal objectively, that is scientifically with your world. You'll be able to critically evaluate the information you encounter daily. You'll be able to evaluate whether information is based on science or not, and you'll be able to separate scientifically verified facts from unverified conjecture. </p>

        <h4>Scientific Research</h4>
         </header>

        <p> Perhaps the simplest reason we can give for why we conduct scientific research is that we seek an explanation for how or why something works the way it does. This basic reasoning applies regardless of the scientific endeavor. We recognize that there are dozens, perhaps even hundreds of scientific disciplines and yet, despite the diversity in their areas of study, the fundamental driver common to them all is that they seek to explain some phenomenon, from the sub-atomic to planetary systems, from the nature of life to the interactions of living beings. Researchers seek to explain how and why these systems work as they do. In fact, this very argument has been given by the American Association for the Advancement of Science, the world's largest scientific society, when they say, "From anthropology to zoology, there are dozens of scientific disciplines with respect to purpose and philosophy, however, all are equally scientific and together make up the same scientific endeavor." We are inherently motivated by a need to reduce our uncertainty about some phenomenon. As we all know, uncertainty is the state of being unknown or indefinite. When we think about uncertainty in the context of a scientific endeavor, we refer to our lack of knowledge in that particular field. Hence, when we reduce our uncertainty in that field, we improve our state of knowledge. Moreover, this, as I'm sure we can all relate, is the essence of what makes us human. As humans, we're uncomfortable with uncertainty, and wherever possible we seek knowledge and certainty. One major reason for basic research is the desire to develop new things. For example, perhaps you are reading this article from a handset device or a computer, that device is the result of more than 200 years of basic scientific research. Literally, thousands of fundamental scientific advances were necessary to create that device. Even if you're not a career researcher, many of us need to make decisions that will impact our personal lives, families and perhaps even our businesses for the better or for the worse. When we make these decisions we want to make sure that whenever possible we have access to adequate and trustworthy data that support the decision. Although we're making person or business decisions we can do so scientifically.</p>

        <h4>Scientific Method</h4>
        </header>

        <p>The scientific method is the process of objectively establishing facts through testing and experimentation. The basic process involves making an observation, forming a hypothesis, making a prediction, conducting an experiment and finally analyzing the results. The principles of the scientific method can be applied in many areas, including scientific research, psychology, business and technology. The scientific method attempts to give accurate information and minimize the influence of bias or prejudice. for example the common <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Confirmation_bias">Confirmation Bias.</a> People display this bias when they select information that supports their views, ignoring contrary information, or when they interpret ambiguous evidence as supporting their existing attitudes. Even the best-intentioned people or scientists can't escape biases. It results from personal beliefs, as well as cultural beliefs, which means any human filters information based on his or her own experience. Unfortunately, this filtering process can cause a person or scientist to prefer one outcome over another. For someone trying to solve a problem around the house, succumbing to these kinds of biases is not such a big deal. But in the scientific community, where results have to be reviewed and duplicated, biases must be avoided at all costs.</p>

        <h3>Distinguishing between Science and Pseudo-science</h3>
      </header>
      <p><strong>Science</strong><br><img src="https://openclipart.org/image/800px/303809" alt="albert einstein" width="200" height="200">
        <ul>
      <li>Their findings are expressed primarily through scientific journals that are peer-reviewed and maintain rigorous standards for honesty and accuracy.</li>
      <li>Reproducible results are demanded; experiments must be precisely described so that they can be duplicated exactly or improved upon.</li>
      <li>Failures are searched for and studied closely, because incorrect theories can often make correct predictions by accident, but no correct theory will make incorrect predictions.</li> 
      <li>As time goes on, more and more is learned about the physical processes under study.</li>
      <li>Convinces by appeal to the evidence, by arguments based upon logical and/or mathematical reasoning, by making the best case the data permit. When new evidence contradicts old ideas, they are abandoned.</li>
      <li>Does not advocate or market unproven practices or products.</li>
    </ul>
      <br>
      <strong>Pseudo-science</strong><br><img src="https://i.pinimg.com/564x/4d/53/c9/4d53c9ef470ccf3fede4b5d3a769e5e2.jpg" alt="pseudo-science cartoon" width="200" height="200"> 
      <ul>
      <li>The literature is aimed at the general public. There is no review, no standards, no pre-publication verification, no demand for accuracy and precision.</li>
      <li>Results cannot be reproduced or verified. Studies, if any, are always so vaguely described that one canâ€™t figure out what was done or how it was done.</li>
      <li>Failures are ignored, excused, hidden, lied about, discounted, explained away, rationalized, forgotten, avoided at all costs.</li>
      <li>No physical phenomena or processes are ever found or studied. No progress is made; nothing concrete is learned.</li>
      <li>Convinces by appeal to faith and belief. Pseudoscience has a strong quasi-religious element: it tries to convert, not to convince. You are to believe in spite of the facts, not because of them. The original idea is never abandoned, whatever the evidence.</li>
      <li>Generally earns some or all of his living by selling questionable products (such as books, courses, and dietary supplements) and/or pseudoscientific services (such as horoscopes, character readings, spirit messages, and predictions).</li>
      </ul>
