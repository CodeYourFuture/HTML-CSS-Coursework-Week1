          <h2>About me:</h2>
          <p class="about-me">
            I have permanently moved from Iran to the United Kingdom in late
            2019.<br />
            <br />
            Prior to this, I graduated with a B.A in Fashion design from “The
            Azad Tehran university” in Iran (2009), a “University Diploma in
            Law” from London Metropolitan University (2012), and a Foundation
            Course in Business from Bellerbys College in London (2009).<br />
            <br />
            Having lived in Iran for 20 years along with my college and
            university education in the United Kingdom gives me the opportunity
            to better understand the people from different social and cultural
            backgrounds, which helped me alot during my study in Fashion
            Design.<br />

          <h3>Who is a Fashion designer and What they do:</h3>
          <p class="fashion-designer">
            Fashion Designers create clothing and accessories.<br />
            <br />
            They often are specialized in a certain area, such as sportswear or
            children’s clothes.<br />
            <br />
            Typical Fashion Designer duties include: discussing requirements
            with clients, using client briefs for instructions, updating their
            knowledge of the latest trends, liaising with suppliers, organizing
            fashion presentations, producing patterns and prints, estimating
            costs, supervising production, and creating mood boards.<br />
            Fashion Designers often use computer-aided design software during
            their work.<br />

          <p class="fashion-show">
            A fashion show (French défilé de mode) is an event put on by a
            fashion designer to showcase their upcoming line of clothing and/or
            accessories during a fashion week. Fashion shows debut every season,
            particularly the Spring/Summer and Fall/Winter seasons. This is
            where the latest fashion trends are made. <br />
