        <p> Biniam Girmay became the first black African to win a stage of a Grand Tour with victory in the Giro d’Italia on Tuesday.

          Girmay, 22, had already made history this season, with his victory at Gent-Wevelgem in March making him the first African to win a Belgian cobbled classic, and added another landmark moment for the sport on stage 10 of the Giro in Jesi</p>

        <p> Daniel Teklehaimanot rode into the history books in the Tour de France when he became the first African to wear the climbers' polka-dot jersey.

          The 26-year-old Eritrean, riding for South African team MTN-Qhubeka, took charge of the mountains classification yesterday with an escape during stage six. Today, wearing the famous white top with red dots, he escaped again to re-enforce his lead.</p>
