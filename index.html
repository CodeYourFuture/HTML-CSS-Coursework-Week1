        <h2>The First Steps</h2>
        <p>
          Are you interested in a career as a web developer but are not sure how to start preparing for it? We have you covered!
          Web developers perform important functions, like creating websites, maintaining the back-end of applications and 
          running tests, to ensure sites' continued functionality. A role as a junior developer can be a great way to learn 
          the basics of the industry and begin a career in website development. If you're interested in becoming a junior 
          developer, it's helpful to learn more about the position and the steps needed to begin your career.
        </p>
        <p>
          There are many technical skills that can help you succeed as a junior developer. One benefit of the role is your 
          ability to work beneath more senior developers to grow your skills and experience. Here are some technical skills
          that can help you in your role as a junior developer:
          </p>
          <h2>Knowledge of basic programming languages</h2>
          <p>
          While the company you work for might employ specific languages, proficiency in common coding and website
          development languages can help you qualify for a position as a junior developer. Often, companies look for
          candidates with experience using JavaScript, HTML and CSS languages. These are three of the most-used web
          development languages. You might also choose to explore other common languages like Python, C++ or SQL
          depending on your career goals and the functions of the sites you're working on developing.<br/><br/>

        <h2>Study Methods</h2>
        <p>
          Your journey to becoming a web developer can begin before college. There are many online resources available to those 
          interested in coding. Not only does learning a language or designing a program in your free time enhance your skills,
          but it also shows prospective employers you're a passionate and self-motivated developer with a genuine interest in
          the field. Some high schools offer computer programming courses or electives. Consider taking these courses to learn 
          more about development and gain valuable skills.<br>
          If your high school doesn't offer programming courses, engaging in math and science offerings can help you prepare 
          for a college setting and improve your chances of getting into a top-tier technology school. Many computer science 
          degree programs require advanced mathematics courses like calculus, so working on your math skills as early as
          possible can be a major benefit.<br/><br/>

        <h2>Networking</h2>
        <p>
          Having a network is also good for your overall health and well-being; something that we, as developers, ignore far
          too often. It can be used for getting help when dealing with stressful work or life situations. Helping other
          people with their issues and problems is also a great way to reinforce your learning, and build a stronger 
          relationship with that person. Strong relationships are key to having good mental health.<br/></p>
          <p><b>Local meetups:</b> A great wy to meet local developers and events are often sponsored by local companies.
          Many are often free to attend and hppen regularly (often monthly). If you ask around then people always seem
          to know one or two you haven't heard of. Meetups typically have someone giving a talk about a technology or 
          process they are passionate about and are great for generating new ideas. Meetups also usually have an “after party” 
          where people will go and have a few drinks and a chat. This is where you will meet new connections, a good tactic is
          to find the speaker to ask some directed questions about their talk. Let the conversation flow from there.<br/><br/>
