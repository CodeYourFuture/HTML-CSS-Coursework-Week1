          <h2>About me:</h2>
          <p>
            I have permanently moved from Iran to the United Kingdom in late
            2019.<br />
            <br />
            Prior to this, I graduated with a B.A in Fashion design from “The
            Azad Tehran university” in Iran (2009), a “University Diploma in
            Law” from London Metropolitan University (2012), and a Foundation
            Course in Business from Bellerbys College in London (2009).<br />
            <br />
            Having lived in Iran for 20 years along with my college and
            university education in the United Kingdom gives me the opportunity
            to better understand the people from different social and cultural
            backgrounds, which helped me alot during my study in Fashion Design.
