  <h2>Wellness Sports</h2>
  <span>Sports have a blend of values that reflects on our day-to-day life. They provide a platform
    to practice discipline and maintain strong bonding with colleagues. Sports push employees out of
     their comfort 
    zone and clubs the work-related pressure with an element of fun.It is a universal fact that in life, 
    you will not always get success from every situation. Sometimes you have to accept failures even 
    though that is the last thing you desire.
    Sports convey this vital message of accepting defeat or success with grace. <br>

  <h2>Wellness Food</h2>
  <span>Wellness is the new way of looking at health. Gone is the strict dieting and focus on disease management. 
  It's now about achieving a state of complete physical, mental, and social well-being, and not merely the absence of disease.
   It's a state of positive health in the individual, comprising biological and psychological well-being as exemplified by quality of life.</span>
