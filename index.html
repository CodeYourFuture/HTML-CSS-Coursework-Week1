      <h2>Nail Extensions </h2>
      
      <p class="p">
        Nail extensions should enhance your own natural nails. They should give you extra length, strength and shape, without being thick and unnatural looking, or causing damage. An electric file will never be used on your natural nails.
        Tipped or sculpted depending on your natural nails, then finished with gel polish. You can add extra nail art including glitters, foils, nail crystals or simple hand painted.

      <h2>Eyelash Extension</h2>
      <p class="p">
        Eyelash extensions are individually applied fibres that are attached to your natural lashes to give temporarily enhanced length and volume. Always applied by a trained therapist, there's a large variety of extensions you can choose from, from 4D to Russian lashes, each promise to give you thicker and fuller lashes that last well over a month. Totally different to the glue-on strip lashes you wore as a teen, depending on what look you’re going for, from natural, glamorous to dramatic, eyelash extensions can give the illusion of longer, fuller lashes without having to apply any mascara. Like brows, eyelashes have the power to transform your face even when makeup is minimal. They add an instant shot of glamour and sophistication that hearkens back to the timeless Hollywood screen sirens of the 40's and 50's, whose beauty was always amplified with long, perfectly fluttering doe-like lashes. And today more than ever the trend for defined brows and larger than life lashes is still dominating the beauty industry, with more and more people choosing to bin their mascaras and opt for extensions. Made up of either synthetic or natural fibres, eyelash extensions typically last for the entire natural growth cycle of your eyelashes (approximately 2-3 months), but to keep them at full capacity you may need to have touch ups to compensate for shedding every 2-3 weeks.

      <h2>Brow Lamination</h2>
      <p class="p">
        Brow lamination is a new, innovative beauty treatment that has continued to grow in popularity, recreating the trending look of thick, bushy brows. Brow lamination is great for those who love a ‘brushed-up' look but can’t seem to tame their brow hair due to it being too straight or fine.
        Generally, brow lamination lasts from four to six weeks. Depending on how well you look after your brows, it can last up to eight weeks. After the four to six-week period, it’s recommended that you get your brows re-laminated in order to maintain the look over a longer period of time.
