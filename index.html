          <h1>Reykjavík</h1>
          <p>While most Icelandic trips start in Reykjavík, this is not a whistle-stop city. Starting or ending your tour in its
          capital is a great way to understanding the country and the culture.
          
          In Reykjavík, you’ll find fine dining, boutique shopping, and trendy bars. But its real charm is in its famed landmarks,
          museums, and cultural attractions</p>
          
          <h3>Marvel at Hallgrimskirkja</h3>
          
          <p>Start by visiting Hallgrímskirkja, the celebrated church of Reykjavík, whose architecture was inspired by the volcanic
          landscape. Standing at 73 metres high, this is the largest church in Iceland! You can even take an elevator up the tower
          to get a sweeping view of the city below!
          
          In front, you’ll find the statue of Leif Eriksson, legendary explorer, who is believed to have been the first European
          to land in North America around the year 1000.</p>
          
          <h3>See a show at Harpa Concert Hall</h3>
          
          <p> Harpa Concert Hall is another architectural landmark of the city, but also serves as a cultural touchstone thanks to
          the numerous musical festivals and shows it puts on. No matter what time of year you come visit Reykjavík, you can be
          treated to operatic Viking sagas, symphony orchestras, jazz festivals, and contemporary bands.</p>
          
          <h3>Visit the Perlan Museum</h3>
          
          <p> Whether or not you’re going to tour the country to discover its rugged and beautiful landscapes, wrought by both fire
          and ice, then you should visit Perlan Museum whilst in the city.
          
          This interactive museum focuses on showcasing Iceland’s natural wonders. It is the perfect place to learn and experience
          it all from one location.
          
          Because Perlan sits atop Öskjuhlíð Hill, this also means you’ll be treated to a great view of the city while you’re
          there. This is an excellent way to kick off a tour to Iceland’s countryside.</p>

          <h1>Blue Lagoon</h1>
          <p>In the Reykjanes peninsula, in the south-west of Iceland, you’ll find the iconic Blue Lagoon. Gracing Instagram posts
          and promotional ads alike, the Blue Lagoon is one of Iceland’s premier attraction sites. And we promise you the
          attention is well-deserved.
          
          The Blue Lagoon is a geothermal spa, a hot spring fed by the nearby geothermal plant, meaning the water sits comfortable
          around 39°C (102°F). Set against a dark lava field background, the milky water is ethereal in contrast. Truly relaxing,
          beautiful and iconic, it is a must-see.
          
          Because of its location near the airport, but also a short journey from Reykjavík, it is ideal to add on to your trip,
          either at the beginning or at the end of your Iceland travels.</p>

          <h1>Golden Circle</h1>
          <p>Whether you take the wheel on a self-drive trip or decide to join a guided group tour, the Golden Circle should be on
          your road plan at least once in a lifetime. Enwrapped in this region is the historical heart of Iceland, and some of its
          most incredible (and famous) natural sites, including impressive waterfalls, geysers, and hot springs.
          
          Be inspired at Þingvellir National Park
          
          The Þingvellir National Park is a major heritage attraction, in part because of its geographical significance (it sits
          at the junction of the Eurasian and North American tectonic plates), and because of its importance in Icelandic history.
          It is here that in the year 930, over 30 ruling chiefs of Iceland joined and created a rudimentary representative
          parliament. When you walk through this dramatic landscape, you can still see the foundations of that site today.</p>
          
          <h3>Heat things up with Geysir and Strokkur</h3>
          
          <p>Iceland is also famous for its geothermal energy and hot springs. Perhaps the most renowned hot spring is the giant
          Geysir. When it is active (it can be years between active periods), this geyser shoots water up into the air as high as
          70m (230 feet). Nearby, you’ll find the much more reliable Strokkur geyser. It erupts every 5-10mins and can manage
          heights of up to 40m (130 feet).</p>
          
          <h3>Walk on the edge at Gullfoss</h3>
          
          <p>Gullfoss means ‘Golden Falls’ and its hard to argue with the name when you see this gorgeous waterfall in the sunshine.
          The falls are fed by the the ice tunnels of the glacier Langjökull that run to the Hvítá river, and it is a spectacular
          way to be introduced to the waterfalls of Iceland.</p>
