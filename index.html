    <h2>Introduction</h2>
    <p>Practicing relaxation is paramount to managing stress. When we relax, the flow of blood increases around our body
      giving us more energy.
      It helps us to have a calmer and clearer mind which aids positive thinking, concentration, memory and decision
      making.
      Relaxation slows our heart rate, reduces our blood pressure and relieves tension.
      It also aids digestion as we absorb essential nutrients more efficiently when relaxed, which helps to fight off
      disease and infection.
      There are many relaxation techniques, here we will explain the ones that you can do in a few minutes anywhere.

    <h2>Visualisation Exercise</h2>
    <p>This exercise involves using an image as a way to focus the mind. Create in your mind an ideal spot to relax.
      It can be:
    <ul>- real or imaginary</ul>
    <ul>- somewhere you will find restful, calming, safe and happy</ul>
    <ul>- a place you would want to return to whenever you feel the need to relax</ul>
    Imagine it in as much detail as you can use your senses to make it
    as real as possible and see yourself comfortably enjoying this place.

    Now close your eyes and take a slow, regular breath in through your nose. Become aware of your breathing. Focus on
    your relaxation place in all its detail and breathe out through your mouth.
    Do this exercise for 10 to 20 minutes.</p>

    <h2>Muscle Relaxation</h2>
    <p>This exercise will teach you to recognise and reduce muscle tension. You can relieve tension in any part of your
      body just by tensing and relaxing each muscle in turn. Sitting in a comfortable chair:</p>
    <ol>1 Close your eyes and concentrate on your breathing. Slowly breath in through your nose and out through your
      mouth.</ol>
    <ol>2 Make a fist, squeezing your hand tightly.</ol>
    <ol>3 Hold this for a few seconds, noticing the tension.</ol>
    <ol>4 Slowly open your fingers and feel the difference notice the tension leaving. Your hand is much lighter and
      relaxed. Enjoy this feeling.</ol>
    <p>If you have any physical injuries or conditions that may cause muscle pain, don't tense the muscle in that area.

    <h2>Breathing to Relax</h2>
    <p>Breathing too quickly, and deeply, can make you feel dizzy, faint or even more anxious.
      Taking slow, regular breaths can help you to control anxious thoughts and feelings, and make you feel calmer.
      To control your breathing:</p>
    <ol>1 Place one hand on your chest and the other over your stomach. You want your stomach to move more than your
      chest as you breathe.</ol>
    <ol>2 Take a slow, regular breath in (through your nose if you can). Watch your hands as you breathe in. The hand on
      your stomach should move and your chest should not.</ol>
    <ol>3 Breathe out slowly through pursed lips.</ol>
    <ol>4 Repeat this 10 times, twice a day.</ol>
    <p>It might take time to master this technique. Once you have, you won't need to watch your hands or put them on
      your stomach.</p>
