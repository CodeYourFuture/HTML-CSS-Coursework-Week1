        <h2>The Best Leg Strengthening Exercises After Surgery</h2>
        <br>
        <p>After surgery to the hip, knee, ankle or foot, the muscles of the leg often become weak from decreased use or
          from
          inhibition due to pain. For this reason, it is important to begin strengthening these muscles once your
          physician
          gives
          you the green light to do so.</p>
        <br>
        <p>Gaining back strength that you have lost after injury or surgery is an important step in obtaining full
          functional
          mobility and a full recovery.</p>

        <h2>Exercises to Keep Your Knees Healthy</h2>
        <br>
        <p>Your knee is a major joint in the body that is responsible for walking, climbing stairs, and rising from a
          seated
          position. Pain in the knee can limit one or all of these activities. By keeping the knee joint mobile and
          strong,
          problems with knee pain may be avoided and your mobility can be maintained.</p>
        <br>
        <p>Exercises are your main tool in maintaining good strength and mobility in your knees, and some simple
          exercises
          that you
          can do at home can help keep your knees moving right. (After injury or knee surgery, your physical therapist
          may
          prescribe exercises similar to these to help you return to normal activity and function.)</p>

        <h3>Nerve Glides as Part of Your PT Exercises</h3>
        <p>Nerve flossing is an exercise technique often used in physical therapy to improve the way your nerves move.
          Nerve
          flossing is also known as nerve gliding or neural glides. Occasionally after injury or illness, muscles,
          joints,
          and
          tendons can become tight. Guess what? Nerves can also become tight after an injury, and your physical
          therapist
          may
          determine that nerve flossing is necessary to help improve neurodynamics (nerve motion) and help you move
          better
          and
          feel better. Your therapist may prescribe nerve glides to help you fully recover. But what is nerve flossing,
          and how is
          it done?</p>
