              <summary>History of the Down Jacket</summary>
                <p>American adventurer Eddie Bauer created the worldâ€™s first down jacket in 1936, for reasons of sheer necessity rather
              than style. After almost losing his life from hypothermia on a mid-winter fishing trip. New York-based fashion
              curator, Shonagh Marshall, explains in <a href="https://www.vogue.co.uk/article/best-puffer-jacket#:~:text=American%20adventurer%20Eddie%20Bauer%20created,curator%2C%20Shonagh%20Marshall%2C%20explains.">Fashion history 101</a>

              <summary>What's your favorite winter coat/jacket?</summary>
              <p>My favorite is the oversized puffer. Having recently moved to a country with a cold climate, at first I did not like the look this gave me at all but the boxy, hip to be a square appearance grew on me. Now it's my favorite mostly because it keeps me warm and as a bonus it falls just below my hips which is a length I prefer over the cropped version or regular fit. Like I did, feel free to describe your favorite
