          <h2>Calm.Try the HALT Practice to Tune In to What Your Body Needs</h2>
          <title>short check-in self-regulation practice</title>
          <p>
            H: Check in with your body for any signals related to hunger. Are
            you hungry in this moment? How do you know? Do you feel it in your
            belly? Do you feel your energy down? Do you feel that “hangry”
            grumpiness coming on that some of us are familiar with? Just
            checking in with what your body and mind might be telling you about
            hunger. Your brain really needs a lot of fuel, a lot of energy,
            especially for impulse control and emotion regulation. So giving
            yourself the nutrition and calories that you need physically in
            terms of sustenance, it’s going to help you make good decisions and
            more effectively regulate those emotions. If there is some bit of
            craving, see if you can respond rather than react to it. Maybe you
            can plan a healthy meal that will satisfy you both physically and
            emotionally. A: Are you activated with the A of either anger or
            anxiety? These can be related to our fight-or-flight responses. When
            we’re in anger or anxiety or more primitive parts of our brain and
            nervous system, when we’re activated, we can’t regulate our emotions
            quite so effectively. We can’t think and reason things through
            considering the long-term consequences of our actions. How does your
            body tell you that you’re angry or anxious? Where in your body and
            your mind are you aware of it? And then making a choice for
            regulating and calming your body. Perhaps taking a few breaths,
            extending that exhale out. Perhaps grounding yourself by pressing
            your feet into the ground or taking a look around you. See the
            shapes and colors in the room. You might tense and release your
            muscles—whatever helps settle your nervous system, so it’s a little
            bit less activated and on guard. L: Are you feeling a sense of
            loneliness, that need for connection? Healthy regulation for so many
            humans actually starts with co-regulation with others. Our
            collective nervous system can ramp us up or can settle us back down.
            Interacting with others is almost like medicine that we need
            sometimes. And we know that social contact starts to build better
            regulation skills, boost happiness, regulate our mood, and help us
            take more effective perspective on the situations that are
            challenging us at any given moment. Checking in: Are you feeling
            lonely or are you feeling connected? And if there is some loneliness
            or longing, what simple action can you do? Can you reach out, text a
            friend, recall a moment of recent connection with others, or find
            some other way to contact someone supportive? And lastly, T. Are you
            tired? Again, our brains don’t function all that well when we’re
            tired, whether it’s because we didn’t get sleep or whether it’s
            we’re overworking and we’ve reached the end of a long, busy,
            frustrating day. Our ability to regulate our attention, even our
            willpower, starts to slip away. We lose cognitive capacity. We all
            feel not-so-sharp when we’re tired. Maybe right now is not the
            moment to take a nap, but can you give yourself perhaps a bit of
            rest? Can you find a way to put into your schedule in the coming
            hours or days a bit more time to yourself to rest and recharge? Or
            you might find a way to give yourself a little bit more sleep at
            night.

            Gratitude Practice: Savor the Moment by Tapping into Your Senses
          </h2>
          <title>gratitude practice about calm</title>
          <p>
            Use the breath to anchor yourself in the present moment. Our minds
            are always so easily pulled to busyness. Bring particular attention
            to feeling the breath, or something in the body, as you bring your
            shoulders down and orient your attention toward gratitude. Next,
            bring to mind a sight you are grateful for. Move through your
            senses, and find one thing to start with that you appreciate that
            comes to you from the world of sight, if you have this available. It
            could be a color…a shadow…a shape…a movement. Remember, it will
            never be like this again. What do you see right now, and can you
            feel grateful that you get to see this, whatever it is? Now, shift
            to a scent you appreciate. As you continue to work with your senses,
            now take time to tune in with appreciation to an aroma. What do you
            notice? What about that glorious or interesting or subtle smell is
            making you smile? It could be gratitude for something familiar: a
            scent that brings comfort, upliftment; or maybe it’s something
            you’ve never smelled before, and it just piques your curiosity,
            ignites you, enlivens you. Moving on, tune into any sounds around
            you. Allowing the world of smell to gently recede into the
            background, on an in-breath, shift your attention to your ears and
            the world of sound. Maybe notice what it feels like to really
            listen. How many sounds can you notice, and can you feel grateful
            that you’re able to experience sound, if you are? What can you
            notice about these sounds—far away? close? Perhaps you could play a
            piece of music that brings you joy, and have gratitude that it’s so
            available? Or maybe it’s the sound of children laughing, the sound
            of loved ones breathing, the sound of the beating of your own heart.
            The world of touch and texture beckons us next. We find so much to
            be grateful for in touch! If there’s someone near who you can hug or
            who can hug you, notice how this makes you feel filled with
            gratitude for the joy of human contact. Or perhaps you have a
            beautiful pet that you can stroke and cuddle, or some lovely
            material with a texture that feels warm to the touch, soft,
            evocative. Let your senses ignite your gratitude! There’s so much to
            be appreciative of. Shift to noticing and appreciating objects
            around you. Now take a moment to look around: Look down, look up,
            and from side to side. Appreciate how much effort must have gone
            into anything at all you own or use. Someone conceived of the need
            and many people worked on the details of the design. Much care even
            went into the packaging to deliver your item to you safely. What do
            you feel when you let yourself be grateful that all that talent went
            into making your life a little easier? As you end this practice,
            carry this attitude of gratitude with you. One last little grateful
            tip: Why not offer your thanks to each person who does anything at
            all for you today? Even if it is their job to help you? When you’re
            grateful, when you let your heart open up and be filled with
            appreciation, notice how being grateful makes you feel. Close with
            gratitude. I’m so grateful that you tuned in to this gratitude
            practice, and I appreciate your time, your effort, and your energy
            to be present, awake, and alive to your precious life. Have a
            beautiful day.

          <h2>
            Anxiety.Being vs Doing: The Difference Between “Being” and “Doing”
          </h2>
          <title>activities to avoid anxiety</title>
          <p>
            Being vs Doing: The “Doing” Mode The ruminative state of mind is
            actually a variant of a much more general mode of mind that has been
            called the “doing” mode. The job of this mode of mind is to get
            things done—to achieve particular goals that the mind has set. These
            goals could relate to the external world—to make a meal, build a
            house, or travel to the moon—or to the internal world of self—to
            feel happy, not make mistakes, never be depressed again, or be a
            good person. The basic strategy to achieve such goals involves
            something we call the “discrepancy monitor”: a process that
            continually monitors and evaluates our current situation against a
            model or standard—an idea of what is desired, required, expected, or
            feared. Once this discrepancy monitor is switched on, it will find
            mismatches between how things are and how we think they should be.
            That is its job. Registering these mismatches motivates further
            attempts to reduce these discrepancies. But, crucially, dwelling on
            how things are not as we want them to be can, naturally enough,
            create further negative mood. In this way, our attempts to solve a
            “problem” by endlessly thinking about it can keep us locked into the
            state of mind from which we are doing our best to escape. The full
            richness of the mode of “being” is not easily conveyed in words—its
            flavor is best appreciated directly, experientially. In many ways,
            it is the opposite of the driven–doing mode. The driven-doing mode
            is goal-oriented, motivated to reduce the gap between how things are
            and how we think we need them to be; our attention is narrowly
            focused on these discrepancies between actual and desired states. By
            contrast, the being mode is not devoted to achieving particular
            goals. In this mode, there is no need to emphasize discrepancy-based
            processing or constantly to monitor and evaluate (“How am I doing in
            meeting my goals?”). Instead, the focus of the being mode is
            “accepting” and “allowing” what is, without any immediate pressure
            to change it. “Allowing” arises naturally when there is no goal or
            standard to be reached, and no need to evaluate experience in order
            to reduce discrepancies between actual and desired states. This also
            means that attention is no longer focused narrowly on only those
            aspects of the present that are directly related to goal
            achievement; in being mode, the experience of the moment can be
            processed in its full depth, width, and richness. Doing and Being
            differ in their time focus. In doing, we often need to work out the
            likely future consequences of different actions, anticipate what
            might happen if we reach our goal, or look back to memories of times
            when we have dealt with similar situations to get ideas for how to
            proceed now. As a result, in doing mode, the mind often travels
            forward to the future or back to the past, and the experience is one
            of not actually being “here” in the present much of the time. By
            contrast, in being mode, the mind has “nothing to do, nowhere to go”
            and can focus fully on moment-by-moment experience, allowing us to
            be fully present and aware of whatever is here, right now. Doing
            mode involves thinking about the present, the future, and the past,
            relating to each through a veil of concepts. Being mode, on the
            other hand, is characterized by direct, immediate, intimate
            experience of the present. The being mode involves a shift in our
            relation to thoughts and feelings. In doing mode, conceptual
            thinking is a core vehicle through which the mind seeks to achieve
            the goals to which this mode of mind is dedicated. This means, as we
            have seen, that thoughts are seen as a valid and accurate reflection
            of reality and are closely linked to action. In doing mode, the
            relationship to feelings is primarily one of evaluating them as
            “good things” to hang on to or “bad things” to get rid of. Making
            feelings into goal-related objects in this way effectively
            crystallizes the view that they have an independent and enduring
            reality.
