          <h2 class="subtitle">Early Life and Education</h2>
          <p>Isaac Newton was born on January 4, 1643, in Woolsthorpe, Lincolnshire, England. The son of a farmer who died three
          months before he was born, Newton spent most of his early years with his maternal grandmother after his mother
          remarried. His education was interrupted by a failed attempt to turn him into a farmer, and he attended the King’s
          School in Grantham before enrolling at the University of Cambridge’s Trinity College in 1661.</p>

          <p>Newton studied a classical curriculum at Cambridge, but he became fascinated by the works of modern philosophers such as
          René Descartes, even devoting a set of notes to his outside readings he titled “Quaestiones Quaedam Philosophicae”
          (“Certain Philosophical Questions”). When the Great Plague shuttered Cambridge in 1665, Newton returned home and began
          formulating his theories on calculus, light and color, his farm the setting for the supposed falling apple that inspired
          his work on gravity.</p>

          <h2 class="subtitle">Academic Career</h2>
          <p>In January 1665 Newton took the degree of Bachelor of Arts. The persons appointed (in conjunction with the proctors,
          John Slade of Catharine Hall, Cambridge, and Benjamin Pulleyn of Trinity College, Newton's tutor) to examine the
          questionists were John Eachard of Catharine Hall and Thomas Gipps of Trinity
          University. It is a curious accident[according to whom?] that we have no information about the
          respective merits of the candidates for a degree in this year since the "ordo senioritis" of the Bachelors of Arts for
          the year is omitted in the "Grace Book".</p>

          <p>It is supposed that it was in 1665 that the method of fluxións (his term for calculus of variations) first
          occurred to Newton's mind. There are several papers in Newton's handwriting bearing dates 1665[11][better source needed]
          and 1666 in which the method is described, in some of which dotted or dashed letters are used to represent fluxions
          (i.e. derivatives), and in some of which the method is explained without the use of dotted letters.</p>
          
          <p>Both in 1665 and 1666 Trinity College was dismissed on account of the Great Plague of London...<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Early_life_of_Isaac_Newton#Academic_career" class="link">Continue reading on Wikipedia</a></p>

          <p>Sir Isaac Newton's accomplishments border on the uncanny, as does his image in the world of science. As the historian
          Mordechai Feingold has written, "With time, the historical Newton receded into the background, overshadowed by the very
          legacy he helped create. Newton thus metamorphosed into science personified." So what is that legacy? What were those
          accomplishments? Here, familiarize yourself with Newton's greatest contributions...<a href="https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/nova/article/newton-legacy/" class="link">Read More</a></p>
