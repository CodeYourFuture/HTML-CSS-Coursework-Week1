      <h1>HAREM</h1>
      <p>My project grew out of the need I felt to document stories,
        especially the stories of people around me. At a certain point, I
        realized that in order to go forward as an artist, it was necessary to Illustrate the world I came from.
        It is obvious that while my photographs are expressions of my own
        personal history, they can also be taken as reflections of the life of
        Arab women in general. I can't think of myself as a representative of all Arab Women. My work therefore documents the experience
        of women around the world have had including myself. it is in this
        story I find my own voice, the unique voice of an artist. this is not
        an attempt to represent myself as the only victim, as this would
        deprive the multitudinous Realities I wish to express.</p>
        <p>Traditionally, the presence of men has defined public spaces:
          From the streets, and to the places of work. Women, on the other
          hand, have been confined to private spaces, the home. Physical thresholds define cultural ones, hidden hierarchies dictate
          patterns of habitation. Thus, crossing a permissible, cultural threshold into prohibited "space" in the metaphorical sense, can
          result in literal confinement in an actual space. I want to stress that I do not intend my work simply as a critique
          of either culture, Arab or western. I am going further than critique
          to a more active, even subversive, engagement with cultural
          patterns, in order to get beyond stereotypes and convey my own experience as an Arab woman.</p>
