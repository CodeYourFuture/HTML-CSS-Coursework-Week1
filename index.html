      <h2>Santiago Island</h2>

     <p class= Santiago Island>
      Santiago is the most African of the islands in the archipelago. It is the largest island in the archipelago and the city of Praia, capital of Cabo Verde, is home to more than half of the country's population. Cidade Velha - formerly Ribeira Grande - is the oldest city created in the tropics by Europeans. It is in the North of this island where the Former Concentration Camp of Tarrafal is located.
      The island is rich in contrasts: there are dizzying mountains, barren landscapes and green valleys after a few drops of rain. Colonial marks, from pirate attacks to the slave trade, are very present, although some are in ruins. The markets are vibrant, bastions of African culture, to the sound of traditional music, agricultural products, handicrafts and unmissable flavors.</p>

      <h2>Fogo Island</h2>
      <img  class= "fogo"src="https://www.anacao.cv/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/1-Vulcao-do-Fogo.jpg"alt="imgem fogo Island">
      <p class="vulcan fogo">The Fogo Island has the highest point of the archipelago, the Fogo Volcano, that is still active, but with no danger to residents and visitors. Due to the majesty of the volcano, the island is as wild as it is beautiful, with fertile land, even with scarcity of water. The wine grown in the crater of the volcano is an evident proof of this, as it is produced on the island, blending an unique flavor and high alcohol content. It is worth climbing the top of Fogo, in a hike that can reach 6 hours walking, accompanied by a specialized mountain guide. Here ii is possible to contemplate the force of nature and live a one of a kind experience on this island.</p>

      <h2>Boa Vista Island</h2>
      <img  class= ""src="https://static.wixstatic.com/media/4d67b7_7eb98052486144a6a4da5f68e81be051~mv2.jpg/v1/fill/w_800,h_599,al_c,q_90/4d67b7_7eb98052486144a6a4da5f68e81be051~mv2.jpg"alt=" beache ">
      <p class="bubista">Germano Almeida, a writer born in Boa Vista, wrote about his fantastic island, remembering the "beaches of thick and white sand, where the sea is deep, gentle and clear; beaches of light gravel and strong waves and also beaches so quiet as if they were lakes or simple puddles". It is because of these beaches, and the warm days moved by the wind, that the island is perfect for the ones looking for a few days in paradise between rest and water sports. There is always fresh fish on the table, a sincere morabeza and the morna sound in the back, reminding families that left by emigration. A perfect day ends on a full moon night in the Viana Desert.</p>

      <h2>Sal Island</h2>
      <img  class= ""src="https://meusroteiros.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Ilha-do-Sal-Cabo-Verde-76.jpg"alt="santa maria ">
      <p class="tourists">
        Sal (translates to salt) owes its name to the mineral that abounds on the island. It's a small, flat, arid island, with a touch of lunar landscape. White sand beaches, a dry tropical climate and warm, transparent waters have long won over tourists who come from all over the world looking for sun and rest. It is the perfect destination to relax. There are exceptional conditions for water sports, such as fishing, surfing, diving, kitesurfing and windsurfing. The Salinas de Pedra Lume, the lava pool of Buracona, the pier of Santa Maria, the Botanical Garden Viveiro and the Gruta do Amor are mandatory stops.</p>
