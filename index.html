        <h1>Positive Psychology</h1>
        <p>
          Positive psychology is a branch of psychology focused on the character strengths
           and behaviors that allow individuals to build a life of meaning and purpose—to move
            beyond surviving to flourishing.
            Theorists and researchers in the field have sought to identify the elements of a good life. 
            They have also proposed and tested practices for improving life satisfaction and well-being.

            <h2>What Is Positive Psychology?</h2>
            <p>
              Positive psychology is one of the newest branches of psychology to emerge.
              This particular area of psychology focuses on how to help human beings prosper
               and lead healthy, happy lives. While many other branches of psychology 
               tend to focus on dysfunction and abnormal behavior, positive psychology is centered
                on helping people become happier.
                </p>
                <p>Positive psychology is designed to "complement and extend the problem-focused 
              psychology that has been dominant for decades," explained the late Christopher Peterson,
               author of "A Primer in Positive Psychology" and professor at the University of Michigan,
               in a 2008 article published in Psychology Today.

            individual level and group level.

            <p>
              Positive psychology can have a range of real-world applications in areas including education, 
              therapy, self-help, stress management, and workplace issues. 
              Using strategies from positive psychology, teachers, coaches, therapists, and employers 
              can motivate others and help individuals understand and develop their personal strengths.
              Some of the major topics of interest in positive psychology include:

            <h2>History</h2>
            <p>
              After the Second World War, the focus of psychology was on treating abnormal 
              behaviors and the resulting mental illnesses.
            </p>
            <p>
              Dissatisfied with this approach, humanist psychologists, such as Abraham Maslow,
               Carl Rogers, and Eric Fromm helped renew interest in the more positive
                aspects of human nature.
