      <h3>Expectation in this journey</h3>
      <p>Learning to code can be challenging, but with dedication and persistence, it is possible to master. Some common
        difficulties include understanding the syntax, debugging, and problem-solving. It can also be overwhelming to
        learn a
        new programming language, especially if it is the first one. Moreover, the lack of hands-on experience and
        finding the
        right resources can also pose difficulties. However, these difficulties can be overcome with practice, patience,
        and
        seeking help from online communities or mentors. Remember that learning to code is a valuable skill and the
        rewards
        are worth the effort.</p>
