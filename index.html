        <section class="picture-1">
        </section>
        <p class="summary">Shiraz is one of the  oldest Iranian cities, with a vibrant culture of art and craftsmanship and a rich history, both of
        which are on spectacular display at the Nasir al-Mulk Mosque, one of the most beautiful mosques in Iran.
        
        With dazzling stained glass, thousands of painted tiles on the ceiling and Persian rugs covering the floor, this place
        of worship is a gorgeous rainbow of color in every direction, like stepping into a kaleidoscope.
      Inside the mosque is an open courtyard with a rectangular pool in the center, surrounded by flowers. The building’s
      facade features dozens of arabesque arches, adding to the beauty of the light show from the stained glass.
      
      Nasir al-Mulk Mosque was constructed between 1876 and 1888, during the Qajar dynasty, which ruled Iran from 1785 to
      1925. It has been dubbed the “Pink Mosque” due to the plethora of pink-colored tiles blanketing the ceiling. The best
      time to visit the mosque is in the early morning, when the sun reflects the stained glass patterns onto the floor.</p>

            <p class="title"> 2. Vank Cathedral, Isfahan, Iran</p>
            <section class="picture-2">
            
            </section>
            <p class="summary">View of the magnificent frescos inside the main prayer hall of Vank Cathedral (Holy Savior Cathedral, Church of the
            Saintly Sisters), in Isfahan, Isfahan province of Iran.
            
            
            
            The cathedral was established in 1606, dedicated to the hundreds of thousands of Armenian deportees that were resettled
            by Shah Abbas I during the Ottoman War of 1603-1618.
            
            
            
            The interior is covered with fine frescos and gilded carvings and includes a wainscot of rich tile work. The delicately
            blue and gold painted central dome depicts the Biblical story of the creation of the world and man's expulsion from
            Eden. Pendentives throughout the church are painted with a distinctly Armenian motif of a cherub's head surrounded by
            folded wings. The ceiling above the entrance is painted with delicate floral motifs in the style of Persian miniature.
            Two sections, or bands, of murals run around the interior walls: the top section depicts events from the life of Jesus,
            while the bottom section depicts tortures inflicted upon Armenian martyrs by the Ottoman Empire.</p>

                <p class="title ">3. Zoroastrian Fire Temple, Yazd , Iran </p>
                <section class="picture-3">
               
                </section>

                <p class="summary">Ahura Mazda (also known as Ahuramazda, Harzoo, Hormazd, Hourmazd, Hurmuz, Ohrmazd, 'Lord' or 'Spirit') is the highest
                spirit worshipped in Zoroastrianism, the old Mede and ancient Persian mythology which spread across Asia predating
                Christianity. Ahura Mazda is the creator of the universe and all the things in it, being at the same time wise and good.
                As with all supreme deities, Ahura Mazda carries a long list of titles and characteristics. He is the supreme being in
                Garothman (heaven), the uncreated spirit. Beyond, apart and without him, there is nothing in existence. He is
                changeless, moving all while not being moved by anyone, has no equal, and no one can take the heavens from him. He
                favors the just man, upholding the truth and proper behavior. Ahura Mazda created the twin spirits, Angra Mainyu, the
                destructive spirit, and Spenta Meynu, the good spirit.
                
                The fire that is burningin this temple is more than 1500 years old and it has been burning since 470 AD. You might wonder how that is possible. Well,
                during years, loyal Mogies (fire worshipers) have been protecting this magical fire and they haven’t failed! The bad
                news is that you cannot enter the sanctum area unless you are a Zoroastrian. But don’t worry, you can see Behram Fire
                behind glass and imagine how many stories it has kept in its heart.
                
                This is a very special fire, but it is not one-of-a-kind. Overly, there are nine Atash Behrams (meaning “Victorious
                Fire”) in the world. The other eight are in India. What makes these fires special to Zoroastrians is that these fires
                are consecrated by sixteen different sources! Like a lightning bolt</p>
