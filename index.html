      Kobe Bryant entered the NBA with supreme confidence, chart-topping machismo and unbelievable athletic skills,
      ready to compete at age 17. And for nearly two decades, his manic-driven will to compete set him apart. In all
      facets of life. He never thought twice about taking a shot in any of his 1,280 NBA regular-season games or any
      playoff contest. He was gutsy. NBA GMs, scouts and opposing coaches consistently called him one of the top clutch
      players in the game.

      <h2>Mamba Mentality</h2>
      <p>
        Known as one of the fiercest competitors in sports history, Kobe Bryant saw his ‘Black Mamba’ alter ego as an
        assassin, obsessed with greatness and eliteness. That pursuit and drive to conquer even the most basic
        fundamentals — of whatever it is you’re trying to achieve or accomplish — quickly became a hashtag and then a
        movement and brand known as the “Mamba Mentality”. “The Mamba mentality is a way of life,” Bryant said. “It’s
        not an attitude per se but a way to live. Just trying to get better every single day. It’s not living with
        a bravado or anything like that, it’s just the simplest form of trying to get better at whatever it is you’re
        doing. … That’s all the Mamba mentality is: Just trying to get better every single day.”
