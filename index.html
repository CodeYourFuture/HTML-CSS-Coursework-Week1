          <h1>Tribute - Keanu Reeves</h1>
          <p>Keanu Reeves is probably the most humble and nicest Hollywood star I have read about to date. His life is indicative of so much personal loss and tragedy, yet he manages to maintain his humane-ness, whilst continuing to support causes he believes in. He also to date does not mind taking pictures with his fans, so cool a guy. Meeting him is one of the items on my bucket-list, so who knows, someday, Lordwilling, hey? </p>

        <h2 id="intro">Introduction</h2>
        <p>
          It is said that the reason Keanu starred in 60 movies is because directors, audiences, co-stars and film-crews love him. He is always prepared, always on time, considerate, communicative and caring. People also say of him that there is no one's name he does not remember or who he has not had a conversation with. Insiders are of the opinion that his desire to share comes from the personal losses he suffered in life. Not only does he give huge donations to causes he have strong ties to, but he even goes as far as sharing his salary when the need arises.

            <h3>Tragedies in his life</h3>
            <p>
              He was a mere three years old, when his dad walked away from his mom and to this day, his relationship with his dad has not been rekindled. As a school-going learner, he also had to adjust to attending four different schools, in the space of five years. Imagine losing your best friend; this was also a tragedy that struck Keanu when River Phoenix died of a drug overdose in 1993 at the age of 23. Asif the aforementioned was not enough, he also had to support his sister Kim who had been fighting cancer since 1991, but thankfully she has been in remission since 1999. He was yet to suffer another crushing blow when the daughter, who was to bear the name of Ava and who he was obviously looking forward to holding, was still-born on Christmas Eve, December 24th, 1999. To crown it all, his girlfriend died not even two years later due to a car crash on April 1st, 2001.

            <h3>Causes he supports</h3>
            <p>
              Keanu is infamous for his generosity. He supports cancer research and frequently donates large sums of money to cancer organisations. Apart from these donations, he is also known for gifting stunt-men and fight trainers with Harley-Davidson bikes and Rolex Submariner watches.
