          I <em>Love</em> Children a lot,though it can sometimes be Challenging to look after them,
          they are fun to be with and will make you laugh.
          Children say the darndest things of course,they are Angels and will believe anything you
          tell them.
          They are gentle souls and are sensitive to changes in their environment,changes like
          <em>emotions in people</em>.

          Children can be easily influenced because of their gentle nature.
          They can be molded through what they see and hear what the adults in their lives do.
          That is why the early growing years of a child is very important.
          It shapes their thinking and their mental health.

          Lorem Ipsum is simply dummy text of the printing and typesetting industry. 
          Lorem Ipsum has been the industry's standard dummy text ever since the 1500s, 
          when an unknown printer took a galley of type and scrambled it to make a type specimen book. 
          It has survived not only five centuries, but also the leap into electronic typesetting, 
          remaining essentially unchanged. 
          It was popularised in the 1960s with the release of Letraset sheets containing Lorem Ipsum passages, 
          and more recently with desktop publishing software like Aldus PageMaker including versions of Lorem Ipsum.
