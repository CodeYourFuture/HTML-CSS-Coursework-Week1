          As I have mentioned at numerous occasions that I enjoy creative work.
          I am very passionate about cars and DIY projects. I really enjoy
          watching YouTube channels about fixing damaged cars or DIY building
          projects.

            I have been in love with cars since childhood. I have recently
            developed interest in cooking and I tend to be creative with it as
            well. I have previously fixed and painted my car, I repainted and
            revamped my parent's place, before we sold it. I trust my instincts
            and do not hesitant to try give it a go.

          These channels have really helped me gain knowledge about small
          details with such projects. Someday, I wish to buy a house or car
          which I can fix on my own and turn it into a modern home or daily
          driver. I follow many YouTube channels related to the topics above but
          I will be sharing my top three below.

          <h3>Goonzquad</h3>
          <div class="paras">
            <p>
              My favourite YouTube channel is Goonzquad. Currently, they have
              over 2.3 million subscribers. They have a new progress video every
              two days. They recently bought a house at the top of a hill and
              refurbished it in almost eighty episodes. They started with Jeep
              Rubicons and within two years, they have also repaired and own a
              Lamborghini Huracan,Ferrari 458 Spider, a Hellcat etc... They
              carry out all repairs in their backyard. To visit their YouTube

          <h3>Tavarish</h3>
          <div class="paras">
            <p>
              My second most favourite YouTube channel is Tavarish. Currently,
              he has over 1.8 million subscribers but he has many super and
              hypercar projects in his garage but the interesting thing is that
              he works and builds more of the mechanicals in a car, with the
              help of a friend named Jared Pink. They have a lot of knowledge.
              Tavarish's show is not only interesting but funny as well. His
              slogan is "I am the warranty". He and two fellow YouTubers had
              started a show called Car Trek. It is very similar to Top Gear. In
              its recent series 4, They all had to buy Ferraris for the price of
              a Toyota and test them to their limits. If you wish to visit
              Tavarish's YouTube channel, click

          <h3>Life Uncontained</h3>
          <div class="paras">
            <p>
              My third most favourite YouTube channel is Life Uncontained.
              Currently, they have over 1.1 million subscribers. They are a
              couple who decided to quit their jobs, sell their house and move
              to Texas from Florida, where they are building their own shipping
              container home. It is very interesting to see the challenges they
              face while living in nature and building their shipping container
              home from scratch. Two years down, they are expecting their second
              baby and about to start painting interior walls in their home. To
