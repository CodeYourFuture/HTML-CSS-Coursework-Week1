    <h3>About Orchids</h3>
    <hr>
    <p>
      The <em><span style="color:blue;font-weight:bold">orchid family </span> </em>one of the largest in the realm of flowering plants:
      More than 25,000 species grow naturally, on every continent except
      Antarctica. <br>The greatest concentration of orchid varieties is found in the
      tropical regions of the world, namely in Asia and Central and South
      America.</br> In most of North America, orchids must be grown indoors
      (exceptions include native species such as the lady’s slipper).

    <h4>How often do orchids bloom?</h4>
    <p>
      It depends on the type of orchid. Phalaenopsis orchids will readily bloom every few months, while other types may be limited to once or twice a year.

    <h4>How long do orchid flowers last?</h4>
    <p>
      Depending on the species, orchid flowers can last anywhere from several days to several weeks. Generally speaking, they will last longer if the orchid is kept in a cool spot, is watered sufficiently, and isn’t stressed.

  <article class="spike">
    <h4>When should I cut the flower spike? </h4>
    <p>
      Soon as the flowers wilt and begin to drop off the stem (called a “spike”), it can be cut. Prune the spike off at the base, being careful not to accidentally snip any leaves or roots as well. Phalaenopsis orchids are an exception: they will often produce more flowers from the same flower spike, so don’t be too quick to snip it once the flowers fade. In fact, leaving the flower spike on Phalaenopsis orchids can speed up the time between blooms.
