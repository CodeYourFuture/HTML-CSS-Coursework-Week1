        <h3>1990-2008: Early life and education</h3>
       <div class="article-txt">
        <p>
          DeMarco was born in Duncan, British Columbia on Vancouver island, and raised in Edmonton, Alberta. 
          His great-grandfather is Vernor Smith, Alberta's former Minister of Railways and Telephones, 
          for whom DeMarco was named, and his grandfather (also named Vernor Smith) was a judge of the
          Court of Queen's Bench of Alberta. His mother, Agnes DeMarco, later changed his name to McBriare 
          Samuel Lanyon DeMarco, after his father left when Mac was 4 and refused to pay child support.
        </p>

        <p>
          He attended McKernan School for junior high. Around this time he started playing guitar, with 
          lessons from his grandmother.During high school he was in several bands, including indie rock 
          band the Meat Cleavers, alternative R&B group the Sound of Love and post-punk band Outdoor Miners 
          (along with current keyboardist, Alec Meen), which was named after a song by English rock band Wire. 
          He started smoking cigarettes as a teenager, which has now become a big part of his image. DeMarco is
          also of Italian descent.
        </p>

        <p>
          After graduating from Strathcona High School in Edmonton in 2008, he became a backing musician. 
          After that, he moved to Vancouver.

    <p>Rock and Roll Night Club impressed his new label enough that they agreed to release a full-length follow-up album.

      One of his songs, "Moving Like Mike", was licensed by U.S. retail outlet Target for a commercial.

      nominee for the 2014 Polaris Music Prize.

      when he performed the song "Let Her Go" on Conan on March 30, 2015. On April 22, 2015, DeMarco announced
      the release of an upcoming album titled Another One, which was released on August 7, 2015, in addition to
      a video depicting the making of Another One.DeMarco describes the album to be a collection of love songs,
      "It's just kind of like every angle of how somebody might feel if they're having strange feelings in their 
      chest." On May 11, 2015, Captured Tracks released the first single of Another One, titled "The Way You'd Love Her".
      Another One received a generally favourable response from music critics, scoring 75/100 on Metacritic.
      Still in Rock has ranked this LP as the third best of 2015.
    </p>

    <p>
      On July 8, 2015, DeMarco released a 9-track instrumental album titled Some Other Ones and called it a "BBQ soundtrack". 
      Later that evening, he hosted a listening party in New York City (where DeMarco was based) for fans to hear Another One, 
      where they could get free hot dogs if they donated to a food bank.

    <h3>2019-present:Here Comes the Cowboy (album)</h3>
    <img class="article-photos" src="https://www.abc.net.au/cm/rimage/10874666-16x9-large.jpg?v=3" alt="A frame from a music video for the album Here comes the cowboy">
  <div class="article-txt">
    <p>On March 5, 2019, DeMarco announced his fourth studio album, 
      Here Comes the Cowboy and shared the first single off the album, 
      "Nobody". The album was released on May 10, 2019 on Mac's Record Label [sic]. A controversy emerged 
      once it was pointed out online that DeMarco's album shared a similar title to the 2018 album Be the 
      Cowboy by Mitski and that her album had also included a single called "Nobody".

      about her album and song title only after determining his own album title and single". 
      Mitski responded to the controversy on Twitter, stating, "I'm 100% sure M
      ac & I just went fishing in the same part of the collective unconscious!".</p>

    <p>The album received mixed reviews from critics and audiences upon release. 
      It marked his first top ten appearance in the US Billboard 200 at number 10. </p>
 
    <p>Released 28 October 2020, DeMarco also
