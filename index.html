                    <p>Cathedral G.located in MacMillan Park, is one of the most accessible stands of giant Douglas fir trees on Vancouver
                    Island. The park protects and preserves an internationally significant representative example of Douglas fir old-growth
                    forest within the Coastal Western Hemlock Biogeoclimatic Zone.
                    
                    Here visitors can stroll through a network of trails under the shadow of towering ancient Douglas fir trees, majestic
                    pillars untouched by the modern world, some more than 800 years old.
                    
                    Trails on either side of the highway lead visitors through the mighty stands of this coastal forest. On the south side
                    you will find the largest Douglas firs, one measuring more than 9 metres in circumference. On the northern side of the
                    road you’ll find groves of ancient western</p>

            <p>Indigenous cultures have a long history of stewarding the land in Cathedral Grove - MacMillan park. These trees provided
            indigenous people including the K’ómoks, Tseshaht, and Te’mexw, with raw materials to support their shelter,
            transportation, clothing, and tools.
            
            When Europeans settled on Vancouver Island, the land came to be owned by logging companies. Governor General Viscount
            Willingdon is credited with bestowing the name “Cathedral Grove” on the park in the 1920s, and even then, it was already
            a popular destination for tourists. For many years, the public petitioned the government unsuccessfully to preserve and
            protect the land for future generations. In 1944, a forester named H.R MacMillan donated 136 hectares and this site was
            formally dedicated as a Class A Provincial Park three years later.</p>
