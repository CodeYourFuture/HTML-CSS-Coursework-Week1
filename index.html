            <h2>Don’t stress about your milk (you have enough)</h2>
          </title>
          <article>
            Your breastmilk is perfectly designed to give your baby everything they need and is even clever enough to adapt in the summer. ‘When you get hot, more blood circulates to your breasts,’ says Angela. ‘The mammary glands in your breast act a bit like sweat glands and this extra blood causes them to produce more milk with a higher water content.’

This means you won’t need to give your baby any additional water. ‘If your baby is under six months, giving additional water can actually interrupt the salt balance in your baby’s body, whereas your breastmilk is perfectly balanced to suit your baby’s age and stage and will give him everything he needs,’ adds Angela.

You’ll probably find that your baby is likely to want to feed more often and for shorter periods to quench his thirst so just be sure to feed on demand rather than sticking to a routine.

            <h3>Make sure you stay hydrated too</h3>
          </title>
          <article>
            As well as thinking about what your baby is drinking, you need to give yourself equal consideration in the heat. ‘Leave water bottles around the house so you can drink whenever you need to,’ says Angela. ‘If it’s a hot day, you’re likely to feel really thirsty as your baby will be taking more water from you.’

            Get in the habit of having a drink every time you feed your baby, and aim to drink an extra litre of water day while breastfeeding (three litres instead of the usual two).
            
            Hydration tracker water bottles, such as HydrateM8 Hydration Tracker can help you keep on top of your fluid intake and if you’re worried you will forget, set regular reminders on your phone. ‘New mums are often too busy to drink or may reach for something like coffee, which is dehydrating,’ says Angela. ‘It’s really important to stay hydrated for your own wellbeing as well as for your milk supply.’
            
            Tip: If you struggle with the volume of drinking so much water, try chilling pieces of watermelon, which is 92 per cent water and will boost your fluid intake. Watermelon is also a good source of replenishing electrolytes such as potassium and vitamins A, B6 and C, plus it will help cool you down.

            <h4> Take a pit stop</h4>

            Summer days out and holidays can mean more long car journeys than usual. ‘Your baby may sleep for longer than usual due to the motion of the car, meaning he might not wake for feeds as often as he would at home,’ says Angela.

            ‘Also bear in mind that the air conditioning in many cars doesn’t quite reach the back so while you might feel quite cool in the front, your baby might be quite hot. If you’re going on a long car journey on a hot day, make extra stops and wake your baby up for a feed.’
            
            Be sure not to go for longer than two hours without taking a break.
