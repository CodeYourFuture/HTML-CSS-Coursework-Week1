          <h3>Good health</h3>

          <p>Good health
            Good health is not just the absence of disease or illness, it is a state of complete physical, mental and social well-being.This means eating a balanced diet, getting regular exercise, avoiding tobacco and drugs and getting plenty of rest.
            Our bodies are like machines that require a balance of protein, carbohydrates, fat, vitamins, minerals and water to stay in good working order.Get the balance wrong and your health will suffer.A balanced diet means eating only as many calories as you use during the day.Any excess will be stored as fat if you eat more than you burn off.</p>

            If joints and muscles are to be kept in good, working order they need regular exercise.If you stop walking, they'll stop working.Your body finds it much easier to deal with threats such as sickness, injury, or the occasional sugary or fatty snack if you are active.Exercise also helps you maintain a healthy attitude to problems and mental pressures.You gain less body fat, tire less easily and feel better.Exercise gives you greater flexibility and strength, prevents boredom and helps you sleep.It also helps you find new friends and learn new skills.
