      Paddleboarding is a water sport in which participants are propelled by a swimming motion using their arms while
      lying or
      kneeling on a paddleboard or surfboard in the ocean or other body of water. This article refers to traditional
      prone or
      kneeling paddleboarding. A derivative of paddleboarding is stand up paddleboarding also called stand up paddle
      surfing.
      Paddleboarding is usually performed in the open ocean, with the participant paddling and surfing unbroken swells
      to
      cross between islands or journey from one coastal area to another.

      <h2>History</h2>
      <article>
        Thomas Edward Blake is credited as the pioneer in paddleboard construction in the early 1930s.[1]

        While restoring historic Hawaiian boards in 1926 for the Bernice P. Bishop Museum, Blake built a replica of the
        previously ignored olo surfboard ridden by ancient Hawaiian aliʻi (kings). He lightened his redwood replica (olo
        were
        traditionally made from wiliwili wood) by drilling it full of holes, which he then covered, thus creating the
        first
        hollow board, which led to creation of the modern paddleboard. Two years later, using this same 16 ft (4.9 m),
        120 lb
        (54 kg) board, Blake won the Pacific Coast Surfriding Championship, first Mainland event integrating both
        surfing and
        paddling. Blake then returned to Hawaii to break virtually every established paddling record available, setting
        1⁄2 mi
        (800 m) and 100 yd (91 m) records that stood until 1955.

        In 1932, using his drastically modified chambered hollow board, now weighing roughly 60 lb (27 kg), which over
        the next
        decade he would tirelessly promote as a lifeguarding rescue tool, Blake out-paddled top California watermen Pete
        Peterson and Wally Burton in the first Mainland to Catalina crossing race—29 mi (47 km) in 5 hours, 53 minutes.
        During
        the 1930s, Blake-influenced hollow boards (called “cigar boards” by reporters and later “kook boxes” by surfers)
        would
        be used in roughly equal proportion to solid plank boards for both paddling and surfing until the new Hot Curl
        boards
        led wave-riding in a new direction. For paddleboarding, however, the basic principles of Blake's 1926 design
        remain
        relevant even today.

      <h2>Renaissance</h2>
      <article>
        Paddleboarding experienced a renaissance in the early 1980s after Los Angeles County lifeguard Rabbi Norm
        Shifren's
        “Waterman Race”—22 mi (35 km) from Point Dume to Malibu—inspired surf journalist Craig Lockwood to begin
        production on a
        high-quality stock paddleboard—known as the "Waterman." Its design, which has arguably won more races than any
        other
        stock paddleboard, remains a popular choice today.

        Shortly after, L.A, surfboard shaper Joe Bark and San Diego shaper Mike Eaton began production, and soon with
        Brian
        Szymanski's North County Paddleboards (NCP) became three of the largest U.S. paddleboard makers, eventually
        producing
        nearly half of the estimated 3–400 paddleboards made each year in the U.S. today.

        L.A. lifeguards Gibby Gibson and Buddy Bohn revived the Catalina Classic event in 1982 for a field of 10
        competitors.
        Concurrently in Hawaii, the annual Independence Day Paddleboard Race from Sunset to Waimea was drawing a few
        hundred
        competitors, many using surfboards due to lack of proper paddleboards on the Islands. As paddlers began ordering
        boards
        from the Mainland, local surfboard shapers like Dennis Pang (now one of Hawaii's largest paddleboard makers)
        moved
        quickly to fill the local niche. On both fronts, paddleboarding has been consistently gaining momentum and
        popularity.

        In 1996 the sport of paddleboarding was making a comeback. Once the domain of only dedicated watermen and big
        wave
        riders in the 1950s and 60s, the sport found a new set of acolytes on the North Shore of Oahu and in Honolulu at
        the
        Outrigger Canoe Club. At that time Hawaii's top paddler was Dawson Jones. After completing the 32 mi (51 km)
        Catalina
        Classic, from Catalina Island to Manhattan Beach, Jones returned to Hawaii inspired to establish a race across
        the
        Ka’iwi Channel. In 1997, the race that is now known as the Paddleboard World Championships was born. Today the
        race
        sells out
