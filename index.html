          <p>
        Wolves in sheep’s clothing have pulled the
        wool over our eyes. For almost 500 years,
        the masses have been thoroughly deceived
        by a cosmic fairy-tale of astronomical
        proportions. We have been taught a
        falsehood so gigantic and diabolical that it
        has blinded us from our own experience
        and common sense, from seeing the world
        and the universe as they truly are.
        Through
        pseudo-science books and programs, mass
        media and public education, universities and government propaganda, the world
        has been systematically brain-washed, slowly indoctrinated over centuries into
        the unquestioning belief of the greatest lie of all time.
        “Children are taught in their
        geography books, when too young to
        apprehend aright the meaning of such
        things, that the world is a great globe
        revolving around the Sun, and the
        story is repeated continuously, year by
        year, till they reach maturity, at which
        time they generally become so
        absorbed in other matters as to be
        indifferent as to whether the teaching
        be true or not, and, as they hear of
        nobody contradicting it, they presume that it must be the correct thing, if not to
        believe at least to receive it as a fact. They thus tacitly give their assent to a
        theory which, if it had first been presented to them at what are called „years of
        discretion,‟ they would at once have rejected. The consequences of evilteaching,
        whether in religion or in science, are far more disastrous than is
        generally supposed, especially in a luxurious laisser faire age like our own. The
        intellect becomes weakened and the conscience seared.” -David Wardlaw Scott,
        “Terra Firma: The Earth Not a Planet Proved From Scripture, Reason, and Fact”<span id="dots-1">....</span>
        
        <span id="more-1">For 500 years an elite cabal of Sun-worshippers has propagated this nihilistic,
        atheistic cosmology/cosmogony unquestioningly believed by the vast majority of
        the world. We have been taught, contrary to all common sense and experience,
        4
        that the seemingly motionless, flat Earth beneath our feet is actually a massive
        moving ball spinning through space at over 1,000 miles per hour, wobbling and
        tilted 23.5 degrees on its vertical axis, while orbiting the sun at a blinding 67,000
        miles per hour, in concert with the entire solar system spiraling 500,000 miles
        per hour around the Milky Way and careening across the expanding universe
        away from the “Big Bang” at an incredible 670,000,000 miles per hour, but that
        you feel and experience none of it! We have been taught that a mysterious force
        called “gravity,” a magical magnetism responsible for keeping everything from
        falling or flying off the spinning ball-Earth, is just strong enough to hold people,
        oceans, and the atmosphere tightly to the surface, but just weak enough to allow
        bugs, birds and planes to take off with ease!
        “Whilst we sit
        drinking our
        cup of tea or
        coffee the world
        is supposedly
        rotating at
        1,039 mph at
        the equator,
        whizzing around
        the Sun at
        66,500 mph,
        hurtling
        towards Lyra at
        20,000 mph,
        revolving around the centre of the 'Milky Way' at 500,000 mph and merrily
        moving at God knows what velocity as a consequence of the 'Big Bong.' And not
        even a hint of a ripple on the surface of our tea, yet tap the table lightly with
        your finger and ... !" -Neville T. Jones
        “I remember being taught when a boy, that the Earth was a great ball, revolving
        at a very rapid rate around the Sun, and, when I expressed to my teacher my
        fears that the waters of the oceans would tumble off, I was told that they were
        prevented from doing so by Newton‟s great law of Gravitation, which kept
        everything in its proper place. I presume that my countenance must have shown
        some signs of incredulity, for my teacher immediately added - I can show you a
        direct proof of this; a man can whirl around his head a pail filled with water
        without its being spilt, and so, in like manner, can the oceans be carried round
        the Sun without losing a drop. As this illustration was evidently intended to
        5
        settle the matter, I then said no more upon the subject. Had such been proposed
        to me afterwards as a man, I would have answered somewhat as follows - Sir, I
        beg to say that the illustration you have given of a man whirling a pail of water
        round his head, and the oceans revolving round the Sun, does not in any degree
        confirm your argument, because the water in the two cases is placed under
        entirely different circumstances, but, to be of any value, the conditions in each
        case must be the same, which here they are not. The pail is a hollow vessel
        which holds the water inside it, whereas, according to your teaching, the Earth is
        a ball, with a continuous curvature outside, which, in agreement with the laws of
        nature, could not retain any water.” -David Wardlaw Scott, “Terra Firma: The
        Earth Not a Planet Proved From Scripture, Reason, and Fact” 
        We have been taught that the
        ball-Earth spins at a constant
        velocity perfectly dragging
        the atmosphere along so we
        cannot feel the slightest bit
        of motion, perturbation,
        wind, or air resistance. They
        say we cannot feel any of
        this motion because the
        magical velcro of gravity
        pulls the atmosphere
        precisely along, and we cannot measure any of this motion because the stars are
        so incredibly far away that over a hundred million miles of supposed annual orbit
        around the Sun amounts to not a single inch of relative parallax change! How
        convenient!?
        We have been taught that the apparent orbit of the Sun, planets, and stars (but not
        the Moon!) around the Earth are all optical illusions, that it is in fact the Earth
        beneath our feet which moves, and our eyes that deceive us. Special exception is
        made for the Moon, however, which is said to revolve around Earth just as it
        appears. Since we only ever see one side of the Moon, we have been taught this
        is because the Moon’s supposed 10.3 mph West to East rotation combined with
        its 2,288 mph orbit of Earth just happens to be the EXACT motion and speed
        necessary to perfectly cancel out the Earth’s supposed 1,000 mph East to West
        rotation and 67,000 mph orbit of the Sun, thereby creating the perpetual dark
        side of the Moon illusion! Oh really!?
        
        Though the Sun and Moon
        appear to be relatively small
        equal-sized bodies revolving
        around a stationary Earth, we
        have been taught that this too
        is an optical illusion, and
        they are in fact thousands of
        miles divergent in diameter!
        They say the Sun is actually
        a whopping 865,374 miles
        across, 109 times wider than the Earth, and, contrary to all experience,
        experiments, and common sense, that we revolve around it! They say the Moon
        is 2,159 miles across, a quarter the size of the Earth, and why they appear the
        same size is because the Moon is “only” 238,000 miles away, while the Sun is an
        unfathomable 93,000,000 miles away from the Earth, and these just happen to be
        the EXACT diameters and distances necessary for a viewer from Earth to
        “falsely” perceive them as being the same size! You don’t say!?
        “A sphere where people on the other side live
        with their feet above their heads, where rain,
        snow and hail fall upwards, where trees and
        crops grow upside-down and the sky is lower
        than the ground? The ancient wonder of the
        hanging gardens of Babylon dwindle into
        nothing in comparison to the fields, seas, towns
        and mountains that pagan philosophers believe
        to be hanging from the earth without support!”
        -Lacantius, “On the False Wisdom of the
        Philosophers”
        “I confess that I cannot imagine how any
        human being, in his proper senses, can believe
        that the Sun is stationary when, with his own eyes, he sees it revolving around
        the heavens, nor how he can believe that the Earth, on which he stands, is
        whirling with the speed of lightning around the Sun, when he feels not the
        slightest motion.” -David Wardlaw Scott, “Terra Firma” 
        We have been taught that those tiny pin pricks of light in the night sky known as
        planets, or wandering stars, are actually physical, globular, Earth-like habitations
        millions of miles away. We have even been shown supposed video footage of
        7
        the one called Mars. We have been taught that the tiny pin pricks of light in the
        night sky known as the fixed stars, are actually distant suns trillions of miles
        away each complete with their own solar systems, orbiting moons, and Earth-like
        planets which potentially harbor alien life!
        We have been taught that the Moon has no
        light of its own but is merely a reflector of the
        Sun’s light, that some Masons from NASA
        actually walked on the Moon, that some other
        Masons from NASA sent rovers to Mars, that
        satellites and space stations are incessantly
        spinning in suspended animation above the
        earth, that Hubble telescopes are taking
        snapshots of distant planets, galaxies, stars,
        quasars, black holes, worm holes, and other
        fantastic celestial phenomena. We have been
        taught that our ignorant ancient ancestors for millennia falsely believed the Earth
        to be the flat, immovable center of the universe, but thanks to modern “science”
        and its Masonic prophets like Copernicus, Newton, Galileo, Collins, Aldrin and
        Armstrong we now believe the world to be a giant whirling sea-earth globe
        careening through infinite space.
        “Modern astronomical teaching affirms that
        the world we live on is a globe, which rotates,
        revolves and spins away in space at brainreeling
        rates of speed; that the sun is a million
        and a half times the volume of the earth-globe,
        and nearly a hundred million miles distant
        from it; that the moon is about a quarter the
        size of earth; that it receives all its light from
        the sun, and is thus only a reflector, and not a
        giver of light; that it attracts the body of the
        earth and thus causes the tides; that the stars are worlds and suns, some of them
        equal in importance to our own sun himself, and others vastly his superior; that
        these worlds, inhabited by sentient beings, are without numbers and occupy
        space boundless in extent and illimitable in duration; the whole of these
        interlaced bodies being subject to, and supported by, universal gravitation, the
        foundation and father of the whole fabric. To fanciful minds and theoretical
        speculators, the so-called „science‟ of modern astronomy furnishes a field,
        unsurpassed in any science for the unrestrained license of the imagination, and
        8
        the building up of a complicated conjuration of absurdities such as to overawe
        the simpleton and make him gape with wonder; to deceive even those who truly
        believe their assumptions to be facts.” -Thomas Winship, “Zetetic Cosmogeny”
        We have been taught that “science” books
        like Newton’s Principia Mathematica which
        propound the spherical heliocentric myth are
        the bearers of truth while backwater
        “religious” books like the Holy Bible which
        propound a flat, geocentric Earth are merely
        outdated myths. We have been taught that
        the universe was unintelligently designed and
        randomly created in a cosmic coincidence of
        nothing inexplicably becoming everything!
        We have been taught that through millions
        upon millions of years of accidental “evolution” and happenstance the Big Bang
        universe began manifesting suns, moons, planets, then water, then somehow out
        of dead, inert elements, single-celled conscious organisms came to life, grew and
        multiplied and mutated into larger, different organisms which continued to grow,
        multiply and mutate gaining diversity and complexity (and losing credibility) to
        the point where amphibians crawled up on land, replaced gills with lungs, started
        breathing air, maturated into mammals, became bipedal, grew opposable thumbs,
        evolved into monkeys, then in one final fluke adaptation a hybrid monkey-man
        was made and the rest is human history.
        “Put together all the imaginary exploits in
        the air specially written to interest the
        young, add to this all the wonderful
        adventures of air-ships recorded in the
        „Daughter of the Revolution,‟ and tack on to
        this all the wild and impossible things found
        in current libraries of fiction, and I venture
        to say that the grand total will record
        nothing so utterly impossible or so supremely ridiculous as this modern scientific
        delusion of a globe spinning away in space in several different directions at the
        same time, at rates of speed which no man is able to grasp: with the inhabitants,
        some hanging heads down and others at various angles to suit the inclination.
        Write down all the swindles that ever were perpetrated; name all the hoaxes you
        ever heard of or read about; include all the impostures and bubbles ever
        9
        exposed; make a list of all the snares that popular credulity could ever be
        exposed to, and you will fail in getting within sight or hearing of an imposture so
        gross, a hoax so ingenious, or a bubble of such gigantic proportions as has been
        perpetrated and forced upon unthinking multitudes in the name of science, and
        as proved incontrovertible fact, by the expounders of modern astronomy. Again
        and again have their theories been combated and exposed, but as often have the
        majority, who do not think for themselves, accepted the popular thing.” -Thomas
        Winship, “Zetetic Cosmogeny” 
        We have been taught that the height
        of stupidity and naivety was when our
        ignorant ancestors believed the Earth
        to be flat, and that if any man
        somehow still thinks the Earth to be
        the immovable center of the universe,
        that they must be the most primitive
        kind of ignoramus. Nowadays the
        label “Flat-Earther” has become
        literally synonymous with “moron”
        and is a common cliché derogatory
        term for insulting someone’s
        intelligence. Upon seeing a book
        titled “The Flat Earth Conspiracy”
        your ingrained instinct was likely to laugh, mock the messenger, and deny the
        very possibility.
        “What strikes you
        as being some
        thoughts that
        people would have
        if - in the short
        space of a few
        weeks - the
        universally held
        conviction that the
        Earth rotates on an
        axis daily and
        orbits the sun annually were exposed as an unscientific deception? Keep in mind
        that a rotating, orbiting earth is not counted as a mere hypothesis or even a
        theory anywhere in the world today. Oh no. Rather, this concept is an
        10
        unquestioned 'truth'; an established 'fact' in all books and other media
        everywhere, church media included. Copernicanism, in short, is a concept that is
        protected in a bunker under a 50 foot thick ceiling of solid 'scientific' concrete. It
        is meant to be impregnable. It is a concept that has become ensconced in men‟s
        minds as the indestructible cornerstone of enlightened modern man‟s knowledge.
        Virtually all people everywhere have been taught to believe - and do believe -
        that this concept is based on objective science and dispassionate secular
        reasoning." -Marshall Hall, "Exposing the Copernican Deception"
        “Ninety-nine people out of a hundred would
        give the same answer to the interrogation;
        and that same answer would be to the effect
        that „the earth is a globe which revolves
        round the sun.‟ The ninety-nine who makes
        this reply would do it because they „know it
        is the case.‟ (!!!) „How do they know it?‟
        Let this question be put to them, and they will
        bestow upon you a withering smile of pity at
        what they conceive to be an imbecility of
        mind on your part, and answer you in
        something like the following style: „It always
        has been so. We learnt it at school. Clever
        men say so; and look how astronomers can
        foretell eclipses;‟ and then lose their temper
        at „the very idea‟ of the globular theory being incorrect, and a haughty „ there
        can‟t be a doubt about it,‟ will close all they have to say on the subject. Now, if
        the ears of these ninety-nine could only be gained, they would be shown in an
        irresistible manner that the philosophy which would speak of a round and
        revolving world is a false philosophy.” -B. Chas. Brough, “The Zetetic” Volume
        1 Number 1, July 1872</span></p>

       <article>
        <p>Ancient civilizations the world over believed Earth to be the flat, immovable
          center of the universe around which the heavens revolved daily cycles in perfect
          circles. This stable geocentric universe, proven true by experience and
          experiments, which reigned undisputed for thousands of years adequately
          explaining all Earthly and celestial phenomena, was violently uprooted, spun
          around, and sent flying through infinite space by a cabal of Sun-worshipping
          11
          theoretical astronomers. Early Masonic magicians like Copernicus, Kepler,
          Galileo, and Newton, along with their modern Masonic astro-not counter-parts
          like Armstrong, Aldrin, and Collins, hand-in-hand with NASA and world
          Freemasonry have pulled off the greatest hoax, propagated the most phenomenal
          lie, and perpetuated the most complete indoctrination in history.
          Over the course of 500
          years, using everything
          from books, magazines,
          and television to
          computer-generated
          imaging, a multigenerational
          conspiracy
          has succeeded, in the
          minds of the masses, to
          pick up the fixed Earth,
          shape it into a ball, spin it
          in circles, and throw it
          around the Sun! In schools where every professor’s desk is adorned with a
          spinning Earth-globe, we are lectured on the “heliocentric” theory of the
          universe, shown images of ball-planets and videos of men suspended in space.
          The illusion created, connivingly convincing, has entranced the world’s
          population into blindly believing a maleficent myth. The greatest cover-up of all
          time, NASA and Freemasonry’s biggest secret, is that we are living on a plane,
          not a planet, that Earth is the flat, stationary center of the universe.<span id="dots-2">....</span>
          <span id="more-2">“We are told that though the earth
          has the appearance of being a vast
          plane, with the sun moving high
          above and over the earth, that what
          we see is a deception, it is an
          optical illusion - for it is not the sun
          that moves, but the earth, with „ the
          sea and all that in them is,‟ in the
          form of a globe, whizzing with
          terrific rapidity round the sun,
          located millions of miles away - its
          mean distance being assumed to be 91 millions of miles, and that the earth
          travels at the rate of 68,000 miles an hour, or 19 miles every second.” -Lady
          Blunt, “Clarion’s Science Versus God’s Truth” 
          12
          “If the Government or NASA had said to you that the Earth is stationary,
          imagine that. And then imagine we are trying to convince people that 'no, no it's
          not stationary, it's moving forward at 32 times rifle bullet speed and spinning at
          1,000 miles per hour.' We would be laughed at! We would have so many people
          telling us 'you are crazy, the Earth is not moving!' We would be ridiculed for
          having no scientific backing for this convoluted moving Earth theory. And not
          only that but then people would say, 'oh then how do you explain a fixed, calm
          atmosphere and the Sun's observable movement, how do you explain that?'
          Imagine saying to people, 'no, no, the atmosphere is moving also but is somehow
          magically velcroed to the moving-Earth. The reason is not simply because the
          Earth is stationary.' So what we are actually doing is what makes sense. We are
          saying that the moving-Earth theory is nonsense. The stationary-Earth theory
          makes sense and we are being ridiculed. You've got to picture it being the other
          way around to realize just how RIDICULOUS
          this situation is. This theory from the
          Government and NASA that the Earth is
          rotating and orbiting and leaning over and
          wobbling is absolute nonsense and yet people
          are clinging to it, tightly, like a teddy bear.
          They just can't bring themselves to face the
          possibility that the Earth is stationary though
          ALL the evidence shows it: we feel no
          movement, the atmosphere hasn't been blown
          away, we see the Sun move from East-to-West,
          everything can be explained by a motionless
          Earth without bringing in all these
          assumptions to cover up previous assumptions
          gone bad.” -Allen Daves
          If the Earth truly were a spinning ball orbiting the Sun, there are several tests and
          experiments which could be, and have been, conducted to prove or disprove the
          veracity of such a claim. For example, Danish Astronomer Tycho Brahe
          famously argued against the heliocentric theory in his time, positing that if the
          Earth revolved in an orbit round the Sun, the change in relative position of the
          stars after 6 months of orbital motion could not fail to be seen. He argued that
          the stars should seem to separate as we approach and come together as we
          recede. In actual fact, however, after almost two hundred million miles of
          supposed orbit around the Sun, not a single inch of parallax can be detected in
          the stars!
          13
          “If the earth is at a given point in space on say January 1st, and according to
          present-day science, at a distance of 190,000,000 miles from that point six
          months afterwards, it follows that the relative position and directions of the stars
          will have greatly changed, however small the angle of parallax may be. THAT
          THIS GREAT CHANGE IS NOWHERE APPARENT, AND HAS NEVER BEEN
          OBSERVED, incontestably proves that the earth is at rest - that it does not move
          in an orbit round the sun.” -Thomas Winship, “Zetetic Cosmogeny” 
          “Take two carefullybored
          metallic tubes,
          not less than six feet
          in length, and place
          them one yard
          asunder, on the
          opposite sides of a
          wooden frame, or a
          solid block of wood or
          stone: so adjust them that their centres or axes of vision shall be perfectly
          parallel to each other. Now, direct them to the plane of some notable fixed star, a
          few seconds previous to its meridian time. Let an observer be stationed at each
          tube and the moment the star appears in the first tube let a loud knock or other
          signal be given, to be repeated by the observer at the second tube when he first
          sees the same star. A distinct period of time will elapse between the signals
          given. The signals will follow each other in very rapid succession, but still, the
          time between is sufficient to show that the same star is not visible at the same
          moment by two parallel lines of sight when only one yard asunder. A slight
          inclination of the second tube towards the first tube would be required for the
          star to be seen through both tubes at the same instant. Let the tubes remain in
          their position for six months; at the end of which time the same observation or
          experiment will produce the same results--the star will be visible at the same
          meridian time, without the slightest alteration being required in the direction of
          the tubes: from which it is concluded that if the earth had moved one single yard
          in an orbit through space, there would at least be observed the slight inclination
          of the tube which the difference in position of one yard had previously required.
          But as no such difference in the direction of the tube is required, the conclusion
          is unavoidable, that in six months a given meridian upon the earth's surface
          does not move a single yard, and therefore, that the earth has not the slightest
          degree of orbital motion." -Samuel Rowbotham, "Zetetic Astronomy"
          14
          When Tycho Brahe
          demonstrated that after
          190,000,000 miles of
          supposed orbit around the
          Sun, not a single inch of
          parallax could be
          detected, desperate
          heliocentrists, instead of
          conceding, doubled-down
          claiming the stars were all
          actually trillions upon
          trillions of miles away
          from us, so distant that no
          appreciable parallax could ever be detected! This convenient explanation, which
          heliocentrists have clung to for centuries, has proven satisfactory to silence the
          uninquisitive minds of the masses, but still fails to adequately address many
          observable phenomena such as our wildly implausible synchronization with
          Polaris and other improbabilities which will be addressed later.
          “The idea that the Earth,
          if it were a globe, could
          possibly move in an orbit
          of hundreds of millions of
          miles with such exactitude
          that the cross-hairs in a
          telescope fixed on its
          surface would appear to
          glide gently over a star
          „millions of millions‟ of
          miles away is simply
          monstrous; whereas, with
          a FIXED telescope, it
          matters not the distance of the stars, though we suppose them to be as far off as
          the astronomer supposes them to be; for, as Mr. Richard Proctor himself says,
          „the further away they are, the less they will seem to shift.‟ Why, in the name of
          common sense, should observers have to fix their telescopes on solid stone bases
          so that they should not move a hair's-breadth, - if the Earth on which they fix
          them moves at the rate of nineteen miles in a second? Indeed, to believe that Mr.
          Proctor's mass of „six thousand million million million tons‟ is „rolling, surging,
          flying, darting on through space for ever‟ with a velocity compared with which a
          15
          shot from a cannon is a „very slow coach,‟ with such unerring accuracy that a
          telescope fixed on granite pillars in an observatory will not enable a lynx-eyed
          astronomer to detect a variation in its onward motion of the thousandth part of a
          hair's-breadth is to conceive a miracle compared with which all the miracles on
          record put together would sink into utter insignificance. Captain R. J. Morrison,
          the late compiler of „Zadkeil's Almanac‟ says: „We declare that this motion is all
          mere bosh; and that the arguments which uphold it are, when examined with an
          eye that seeks for truth, mere nonsense, and childish absurdity.” -William
          Carpenter, “100 Proofs the Earth is Not a Globe” 
          Another experiment
          repeatedly performed
          to disprove Earth’s
          supposed rotation
          under our feet is
          firing cannons
          vertically and
          horizontally in all
          cardinal directions.
          If the Earth were truly spinning Eastwards underneath us as the heliocentric
          model suggests then vertically-fired cannonballs should fall significantly due
          West. In actual fact, though, whenever this has been tested, vertically-fired
          cannonballs, perfectly aimed with a plumb line, lit with a slow match, shoot
          upwards an average of 14 seconds ascending, 14 seconds descending, and fall
          back to the ground no more than 2 feet away from the cannon, sometimes
          directly back into the muzzle! If the Earth were actually spinning at the
          supposed rate of 600-700 mph at the mid-latitudes of England and America
          where the tests have been performed, the cannonballs should fall a full 8,400
          feet, or over a mile and a half behind the cannon!
          “The following experiment has been tried many times, and the reasonable
          deductions from it are entirely against any theory of earth‟s motion: A loaded
          cannon was set vertical by plumb-line and spirit-level and fired. The average
          time the ball was in the air was 28 seconds. On several occasions the ball
          returned to the mouth of the cannon, and never fell more than 2 feet from its
          base. Now, let us see what the result would be if the earth were a rapidly
          rotating sphere. The ball would partake of two motions, the one from the cannon
          vertical, and the other from the earth, from west to east. While it had been
          ascending, the earth, with the cannon, would have moved significantly. In
          descending it would have no impulse from the earth‟s motion or from the
          16
          cannon, and would fall in a straight line, but during the time it were falling, the
          earth, with the cannon, would have travelled on, and the ball would fall
          (allowing the world‟s rotation to be 600 miles per hour in England) more than a
          mile and a half behind the cannon.” -A.E. Skellam
          Again, at this point, instead of
          conceding, desperate heliocentrists
          triple-down claiming the reason
          cannonballs fall straight back is
          because the magical properties of
          gravity allow Earth to somehow drag
          the entire lower-atmosphere in
          perfect synchronization with its axial
          spin rendering even such break-neck
          speeds completely unnoticeable to
          the observer and unmeasurable by
          experimentation! This highly
          implausible, though clever and
          convenient explanation only holds
          for vertically-fired cannons,
          however. If cannons are instead fired
          and measured in all cardinal directions, even the heliocentrists’ atmosphericvelcro
          trump-card becomes unplayable. North/South-firing cannonballs establish
          a control, then the East-firing cannonballs should fall significantly farther than
          all others and West-firing cannonballs should fall significantly closer due to the
          supposed 19 mile per second Eastward rotation of the Earth. In actual fact,
          however, regardless of which direction cannons are fired, North, South, East, or
          West, the distance covered is always the same.
          “When sitting in a rapidly-moving railway carriage, let a spring-gun be fired
          forward, or in the direction in which the train is moving. Again, let the same gun
          be fired, but in the opposite direction; and it will be found that the ball or other
          projectile will always go farther in the first case than in the latter. If a person
          leaps backwards from a horse in full gallop, he cannot jump so great a distance
          as he can by jumping forward. Leaping from a moving sledge, coach, or other
          object, backwards or forwards, the same results are experienced. Many other
          practical cases could be cited to show that any body projected from another
          body in motion, does not exhibit the same behaviour as it does when projected
          from a body at rest. Nor are the results the same when projected in the same
          direction as that in which the body moves, as when projected in the opposite
          17
          direction; because, in the former case, the projected body receives its momentum
          from the projectile force, plus that given to it by the moving body; and in the
          latter case, this momentum, minus that of the moving body. Hence it would be
          found that if the earth is moving rapidly from west to east, a cannon fired in a
          due easterly direction would send a ball to a greater distance than it would if
          fired in a due westerly direction. But the most experienced artillerymen - many of
          whom have had great practice, both at home and abroad, in almost every
          latitude - have declared that no difference whatever is observable. That in
          charging and pointing their guns, no difference in the working is ever required.
          Gunners in war ships have noticed a considerable difference in the results of
          their firing from guns at the bow, when sailing rapidly towards the object fired
          at, and when firing from guns placed at the stern while sailing away from the
          object: and in both cases the results are different to those observed when firing
          from a ship at perfect rest. These details of practical experience are utterly
          incompatible with the supposition of a revolving earth." -Dr. Samuel
          Rowbotham, "Zetetic Astronomy, Earth Not a Globe!” 
          “It is in evidence that, if a projectile be fired from a
          rapidly moving body in an opposite direction to that
          in which the body is going, it will fall short of the
          distance at which it would reach the ground if fired
          in the direction of motion. Now, since the Earth is
          said to move at the rate of nineteen miles in a second
          of time, „from west to east,‟ it would make all the
          difference imaginable if the gun were fired in an
          opposite direction. But, as, in practice, there is not
          the slightest difference, whichever way the thing may
          be done, we have a forcible overthrow of all fancies
          relative to the motion of the Earth.” -William
          Carpenter, “100 Proofs the Earth is Not a Globe” 
          During the Crimean War, the subject of artillery-fire in connection with the
          Earth’s rotation became a hotly discussed topic among military men, scientists,
          philosophers and statesmen. Around this time, on December 20th, 1857, British
          Prime Minister Lord Palmerston wrote to the Secretary of War Lord Panmure,
          stating, “There is an investigation which it would be important and at the same
          time easy to make, and that is, whether the rotation of the earth on its axis has
          any effect on the curve of a cannon-ball in its flight. One should suppose that it
          has, and that while the cannon-ball is flying in the air, impelled by the
          gunpowder in a straight line from the cannon's mouth, the ball would not follow
          18
          the rotation of the earth in the same manner which it would do if lying at rest on
          the earth's surface. If this be so, a ball fired in the meridional direction--that is to
          say, due south or due north--ought to deviate to the west of the object at which it
          was aimed, because during the time of flight, that object will have gone to the
          east somewhat faster than the cannon-ball will have done… The trial might be
          easily made in any place in which a free circle of a mile or more radius could be
          obtained; and a cannon placed in the centre of that circle, and fired alternately
          north, south, east, and west, with equal charges, would afford the means of
          ascertaining whether each shot flew the same distance or not.”
          Several such experiments have since been performed and shown that projectiles
          fired in various directions on Earth’s surface always cover comparable distances
          with no appreciable difference whatsoever. These results are entirely against the
          theory of a rotating, revolving world and serve as direct empirical evidence for
          the stationary Earth.
          More evidence, similar
          to the cannonball
          experiment is found in
          helicopters and
          airplanes. If the Earth
          were spinning several
          hundred miles per hour
          beneath our feet,
          helicopter pilots and
          hot-air balloonists
          should be able to
          simply ascend straight
          up, hover, and wait for their lateral destinations to reach them! Since such a
          thing has never happened in the history of aeronautics, however, haughty
          heliocentrists must once again rely on Newton’s magical atmospheric-velcro,
          claiming the lower atmosphere (up to an undetermined height, somewhere above
          the reach of helicopters, hot-air balloons, and anything not built by NASA) is
          pulled perfectly along with the rotating Earth rendering such experiments moot.
          Granting heliocentrists their atmospheric-glue supposition helps them dismiss the
          results of vertically-fired cannonball experiments, but does not and cannot help
          them explain away the results of horizontal cardinally-fired cannonballs.
          Similarly, granting them their magic-velcro helps dismiss the results of hovering
          helicopter and hot-air balloon experiments, but does not and cannot explain away
          19
          the results of airplanes flying in cardinal directions. For instance, if both the
          Earth and its lower atmosphere are supposedly rotating together Eastwards 1,038
          miles per hour at the equator, then airplane pilots would need to make an extra
          1,038 mph compensation acceleration when flying Westwards! North and
          South-bound pilots would by necessity have to set diagonal courses to
          compensate! Since no such compensations are ever necessary except in the
          imaginations of astronomers, it follows that the Earth does not move.
          “If flying had been
          invented at the time
          of Copernicus, there
          is no doubt that he
          would have soon
          realized that his
          contention regarding
          the rotation of the
          earth was wrong, on
          account of the
          relation existing
          between the speed of
          an aircraft and that of the earth‟s rotation. The distance covered by an aircraft
          would be reduced or increased by the speed of the rotation according to whether
          such aircraft travelled in the same direction, or against it. Thus, if the earth
          rotates, as it is said, at 1,000 miles an hour, and a plane flies in the same
          direction at only 500 miles, it is obvious that its place of destination will be
          farther removed every minute. On the other hand, if flying took place in the
          direction opposite to that of the rotation, a distance of 1,500 miles would be
          covered in one hour, instead of 500, since the speed of the rotation is to be added
          to that of the plane. It could also be pointed out that such a flying speed of 1,000
          miles an hour, which is supposed to be that of the earth‟s rotation, has recently
          been achieved, so that an aircraft flying at this rate in the same direction as that
          of the rotation could not cover any ground at all. It would remain suspended in
          mid-air over the spot from which it took off, since both speeds are equal. There
          would, in addition, be no need to fly from one place to another situated on the
          same latitude. The aircraft could just rise and wait for the desired country to
          arrive in the ordinary course of the rotation, and then land.” -Gabrielle Henriet,
          “Heaven and Earth” 
          The heliocentric theory, literally “flying” in the face of direct observation,
          experimental evidence and common sense, maintains that the ball-Earth is.

     <article>
      <p> Whether at sealevel,
        the top of
        Mount Everest, or
        flying a hundred
        thousand feet in
        the air, the always
        horizontal horizon
        line always rises
        up to meet the eye-level of the observer and remains perfectly flat. You can test
        for yourself on a beach or hilltop, in a large field or desert, aboard a hot-air
        balloon or helicopter; you will see the panoramic horizon ascend with you and
        remain completely level all around. If the Earth were actually a big ball,
        however, the horizon should sink as you ascend, not rise to your eye-level, and it
        would dip at each end of your periphery, not remain flat all around. Standing in
        a rising balloon, you would have to look downwards to the horizon; the highest
        point of the ball-Earth would be directly beneath you and declining on each side.
        In an editorial from the
        London Journal, July 18,
        1857, one journalist described
        quite the opposite in his hotair
        balloon ascent, “The chief
        peculiarity of the view from a
        balloon at a considerable
        elevation was the altitude of
        the horizon, which remained
        practically on a level with the
        eye at an elevation of two miles, causing the surface of the earth to appear
        concave instead of convex, and to recede during the rapid ascent, whilst the horizon and the balloon seemed to be stationary.” J. Glaisher wrote in his,
        “Travels in the Air,” that “On looking over the top of the car, the horizon
        appeared to be on a level with the eye, and taking a grand view of the whole
        visible area beneath, I was struck with its great regularity; all was dwarfed to
        one plane; it seemed too flat.” M. Victor Emanuel, another hot-air balloonist,
        wrote that, “Instead of the earth declining from the view on either side, and the
        higher part being under the car, as is popularly supposed, it was the exact
        opposite; the lowest part, like a huge basin, being immediately under the car,
        and the horizon on all sides rising to the level of the eye.” Yet another American
        hot-air balloonist, Mr. Elliot wrote, “The aeronaut may well be the most skeptical
        man about the rotundity of the earth.
        Philosophy forces the truth upon us;
        but the view of the earth from the
        elevation of a balloon is that of an
        immense terrestrial basin, the deeper
        part of which is directly under one‟s
        feet.” And in Mayhew’s “Great
        World of London,” one aeronaut
        recorded that, “Another curious effect
        of the aerial ascent was, that the Earth, when we were at our greatest altitude,
        positively appeared concave, looking like a huge dark bowl, rather than the
        convex sphere such as we naturally expect to see it. The horizon always appears
        to be on a level with our eye, and seems to rise as we rise, until at length the
        elevation of the circular boundary line of the sight becomes so marked that the
        Earth assumes the anomalous appearance as we have said of a concave rather

        have sent
        balloons to
        heights of
        over
        121,000 feet
        and you can
        watch video
        online of
        the horizon rising with the camera-level and remaining perfectly flat 360 degrees
        around. NASA videos and other “official” sources, however, such as the recent
        Red Bull skydive at 128,000 feet have been caught adding fake curvature to the
        Earth via wide-angle lenses and post-production work. Panoramic photos atop
        34
        Mount Everest also often claim to be displaying Earth’s curvature, but this is
        simply the result of distortions and limitations inherent in wide-angle lenses.
        The full extent of NASA’s camera trickery and doctored CGI sphere Earth
        pictures/videos will be exposed in detail later.
        “The camera
        distorted
        horizons have
        always been a
        misleading
        factor with
        those who have
        not freed their
        minds from the
        „planet‟ or
        „globe earth
        indoctrination.‟ Three or four years ago, the U.S.I.S. booklet „Science
        Horizons,‟ carried a note to the effect that the Americans hoped to produce a
        lens which would NOT distort level horizons. So far I am not aware that such
        aid to truer photography has yet been made available. Flat Earthists however
        can prove that due to the known laws of perspective, the horizon, optically rises
        and remains level with the observer‟s, or the camera‟s eye, no matter what
        height is achieved. In fact the earth immediately beneath balloon, airplane,
        rocket or capsule, presents a dish-shaped or concave appearance. The point of
        earth immediately below the vehicle is the lowest. It is NOT the highest point of
        your „globe‟ earth with the dip or curvature of the „ball‟ sweeping away
        downwards to a horizon far away below the eye level.” -Samuel Shenton, “The
        Plane Truth”
        If the Earth were
        actually a big ball
        25,000 miles in
        circumference, the
        horizon would be
        noticeably curved even
        at sea-level, and
        everything on or
        approaching the horizon
        would appear to tilt backwards slightly from your perspective. Distant buildings
        along the horizon would all look like leaning towers of Piza falling away from
        35
        the observer. A hot-air balloon taking off then drifting steadily away from you,
        on a ball-Earth would slowly and constantly appear to lean back more and more
        the farther away it flew, the bottom of the basket coming gradually into view as
        the top of the balloon disappears from sight. In reality, however, buildings,
        balloons, trees, people, anything and everything at right angles to the
        ground/horizon remains so regardless the distance of the observer.
        “The marine horizon, from whatever position it is viewed, always appears to be,
        and is, in fact, a perfectly level line, and since this appearance is the same in all
        parts of the world, its surface must be level; and therefore the Earth is a Plane.
        This may be proved to be the case, by erecting at a suitable elevation on the sea
        shore, a duly-levelled board, or a string - at right angles to a plumb-line - tightly
        stretched between two vertical poles. On looking towards the sea, the horizontal
        line for a distance of 20 miles may be easily observed, and throughout its entire
        length it will be found to coincide with the straight-edge, or string: but if the
        earth were a globe, the horizontal line would form an arc of twenty miles in
        length, curveting both ways from the center, at the rate of eight inches,
        multiplied by the square of the distance. Hence the horizontal line at either end
        of the distance ought to be depressed some 66 feet below the horizon in the
        center. But as no such appearance is ever presented, it necessarily follows that
        the earth cannot be a globe, or other than a plane.” -B. Chas. Brough, “The
        Zetetic” Volume 1 Number 1, July 1872
        Anyone can prove the
        sea-horizon perfectly
        straight and the entire
        Earth perfectly flat
        using nothing more
        than a level, tripods
        and a wooden plank.
        At any altitude above
        sea-level, simply fix a
        6-12 foot long,
        smooth, leveled board edgewise upon tripods and observe the skyline from eyelevel
        behind it. The distant horizon will always align perfectly parallel with the
        upper edge of the board. Furthermore, if you move in a half-circle from one end
        of the board to the other whilst observing the skyline over the upper edge, you
        will be able to trace a clear, flat 10-20 miles depending on your altitude. This
        would be impossible if the Earth were a globe and the surface of water convex!
        If the Earth were actually a globe 25,000 miles in circumference, the horizon
        36
        would align over the center of the board but then gradually, noticeably decline
        towards the extremities. Just ten miles on each side would necessitate an easily
        visible curvature of 66.6 feet from each end to the center.
        “It is known that the horizon at sea, whatever distance it may extend to the right
        and left of the observer on land, always appears as a straight line. The following
        experiment has been tried in various parts of the country. At Brighton, on a
        rising ground near the race course, two poles were fixed in the earth six yards
        apart, and directly opposite the sea. Between these poles a line was tightly
        stretched parallel to the horizon. From the center of the line the view embraced
        not less than 20 miles on each side making a distance of 40 miles. A vessel was
        observed sailing directly westwards; the line cut the rigging a little above the
        bulwarks, which it did for several hours or until the vessel had sailed the whole
        distance of 40 miles. The ship coming into view from the east would have to
        ascend an inclined plane for 20 miles until it arrived at the center of the arc,
        whence it would have to descend for the same distance. The square of 20 miles
        multiplied by 8 inches gives 266 feet as the amount the vessel would be below the
        line at the beginning and at the end of the 40 miles.” -Dr. Samuel Rowbotham,
        “Zetetic Astronomy, Earth Not a Globe!” 
        From the highland near
        Portsmouth Harbor in
        Hampshire, England looking
        across Spithead to the Isle of
        Wight, the entire base of the
        island, where water and land
        come together composes a
        perfectly straight line 22
        statute miles long.
        According to the ball-Earth theory, the Isle of Wight should decline 80 feet from
        the center on each side to account for the necessary curvature. The cross-hairs of
        a good theodolite directed there, however, have repeatedly shown the land and
        water line to be perfectly level.
        On a clear day from the highland near Douglas Harbor on the Isle of Man, the
        whole length of the coast of North Wales is often plainly visible to the naked
        eye. From the Point of Ayr at the mouth of the River Dee to Holyhead
        comprises a 50 mile stretch which has also been repeatedly found to be perfectly
        horizontal. If the Earth actually had curvature of 8 inches per mile squared, as
        NASA and modern astronomy claim, the 50 mile length of Welsh coast seen
        37
        along the horizon in Liverpool Bay would have to decline from the center-point
        an easily detectable 416 feet on each side!
        “But as such declination, or downward
        curvation, cannot be detected, the
        conclusion is logically inevitable that it has
        no existence. Let the reader seriously ask
        whether any and what reason exists in
        Nature to prevent the fall of more than 400
        feet being visible to the eye, or incapable of
        detection by any optical or mathematical
        means whatever. This question is especially
        important when it is considered that at the
        same distance, and on the upper outline of
        the same land, changes of level of only a
        few yards extent are quickly and
        unmistakably perceptible. If a man is
        guided by evidence and reason, and
        influenced by a love of truth and
        consistency, he cannot longer maintain that the earth is a globe. He must feel
        that to do so is to war with the evidence of his senses, to deny that any
        importance attaches to fact and experiment, to ignore entirely the value of
        logical process, and to cease to rely upon practical induction.” -Dr. Samuel
        Rowbotham, “Zetetic Astronomy, Earth Not a Globe!”</span></p>
