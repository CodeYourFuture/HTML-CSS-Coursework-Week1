  <h2>The Best Leg Strengthening Exercises After Surgery</h2>
  <br>
  <p>After surgery to the hip, knee, ankle or foot, the muscles of the leg often become weak from decreased use or from
  inhibition due to pain. For this reason, it is important to begin strengthening these muscles once your physician gives
  you the green light to do so.</p>
  <br>
  <p>Gaining back strength that you have lost after injury or surgery is an important step in obtaining full functional
  mobility and a full recovery.</p>

  <h2>Nerve Flossing in Physical Therapy</h2>
  <h3>Nerve Glides as Part of Your PT Exercises</h3>
  <br>
  <p>Nerve flossing is an exercise technique often used in physical therapy to improve the way your nerves move. Nerve
  flossing is also known as nerve gliding or neural glides. Occasionally after injury or illness, muscles, joints, and
  tendons can become tight. Guess what? Nerves can also become tight after an injury, and your physical therapist may
  determine that nerve flossing is necessary to help improve neurodynamics (nerve motion) and help you move better and
  feel better. Your therapist may prescribe nerve glides to help you fully recover. But what is nerve flossing, and how is
  it done?</p>
  <br>
  Neurodynamics in Physical Therapy
  <p>Your nervous system is grossly divided into two parts: The central nervous system, consisting of the brain and spinal
  cord, and the peripheral nervous system. The peripheral nervous system are the nerves that exit your spinal cord and
  travel through your body to your arms, trunk, and legs. These nerves communicate information from your body to your
  brain to tell it what is going on. They sense things like temperature, pain, pressure, and position. The peripheral
  nerves also communicate information from your brain to your muscles, telling them to move or relax.</p>
  <br>
  <p>After an injury, these peripheral nerves may become tight. Consider the sciatic nerve in your leg. It is the largest
  nerve in your body. (You have two of them; one on each side.) If this nerve becomes pinched by a facet joint or
  herniated disc, slight damage to the membrane of the nerve may occur. This damage may result in a bit of scar tissue
  developing around the nerve, leading to tightness, pain, or tingling in that area where the nerve courses. The nerve
  travels all the way down your leg, and the tightness in the nerve may limit your ability to fully move the joints of
  your hips, knees, or ankles. A tight nerve is also sometimes referred to as an adhered or adherent nerve root.1</p>
  <br>
  <p>Nerve pinching and injury may also occur in the arms, leading to tightness there. This may occur after a pinched nerve
  in your cervical spine, or may happen after repetitive strain or an injury to your arm or arms. A common upper extremity
  nerve injury is called carpal tunnel syndrome. This often leads to pain, tingling, and weakness in your hand and thumb
  muscles.</p>
  <br>.

  Why Nerve Flossing Is Prescribed
  <p>After an injury or illness, you may benefit from physical therapy (PT) to help you fully recover. Your therapist will
  assess you for various impairments. These may include measures of:</p>
  
  Strength
  Flexibility
  Range of motion
  Balance and proprioception
  Nerve tension
  <br>
  <p>If your physical therapist determines that nerve tension and tightness may be a component in your pain or limited
  motion, they may prescribe nerve flossing exercises to improve mobility of the nerve or nerves.</p>
  <br>
  <p>The goal of nerve flossing is to decrease pain, improve range of motion and flexibility, and improve function and
  motion.</p>

Exercises to Keep Your Knees Healthy
<br>
<p>Your knee is a major joint in the body that is responsible for walking, climbing stairs, and rising from a seated
position. Pain in the knee can limit one or all of these activities. By keeping the knee joint mobile and strong,
problems with knee pain may be avoided and your mobility can be maintained.</p>
<br>
<p>Exercises are your main tool in maintaining good strength and mobility in your knees, and some simple exercises that you
can do at home can help keep your knees moving right. (After injury or knee surgery, your physical therapist may
prescribe exercises similar to these to help you return to normal activity and function.)</p>
<br>
</p>Exercise routines to help maintain healthy knees:</p>
Quad Sets
Heel Slides
Short Arc Quad Exercises
Straight Leg Raises
