      <p>Seeing South Africa's natural land will make you see the wonders and Beauty of God's work,<br> yet many who
        live here have never seen these places.</p>

        <h2>Mpumalanga</h2>
        <p>Mpumalanga's Panorama Route could be covered in one day, <br>but with so much to see it would be a real shame
          to rush it. Hugging the edge of the Great Escarpment to the west of Kruger Park, there are epic views over the
          Lowveld from such well-named spots as God's Window and Wonder View. Waterfalls pour over the cliff in many
          places, among them Berlin, Lisbon, Mac Mac, Bridal Veil, Sabie and Horseshoe Falls.</p>

        <h2>Drakensburg Mountains</h2>
        <p>Much of South Africa stands on the Southern African plateau, between 1,000 and 2,100m high, whose edge
          follows a large coastal plain around the country and divides it into Highveld and Bushveld.<br> This Great
          Escarpment reaches its highest point in the east, along the border with Lesotho, where it is known as the
          Drakensberg.<br> Nearly 3,500m at their highest, these peaks make up some of the most striking scenery in
          Africa, if not the world, and are often touched with snow in winter.</p>

        <h2>Cape Town</h2>
        <p>Chapman's Peak is on Hout Bay, the next bay south of Cape Town. <br>It's famous for a road hacked out of the
          sheer side of the mountain, a scenic drive that is familiar to every South African from glossy car
          adverts.<br> The best way to fully enjoy the view, however, is with a hike that adds the road itself to the
          spectacular view.</p>
