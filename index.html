          <h2>section heading</h2>
          <p>Patience Gray died at the age of 87 in March, 2005, at Spigolizzi, her home on the Salentine Peninsula of Puglia. She was the author of one of the best books that will ever be written about food: Honey From a Weed, published in 1986.</p>
          <p>Honey From a Weed is still available, in a paperback edition, from its original publisher, <a href ="https://prospectbooks.co.uk/products-page/current-titles/honey-from-a-weed/" target="_blank">Prospect Books</a>.</p>

          <p>Patience Gray was first known for the 1950s classic, <a href ="https://persephonebooks.co.uk/products/plats-du-jour" target="_blank">Plats du Jour</a>, but her greatest work was this passionate autobiographical cookery book Honey from a Weed. It is Mediterranean through and through, and as compelling as a first-class novel. First published in 1986, the book is now published in the original format, but with soft covers. She shared the life of a sculptor, Norman Mommens, whose appetite for marble and sedimentary rocks took them to Tuscany, Catalonia, the Cyclades (Naxos) and Apulia. These are the places which in turn inspired this rhapsodic text.</p>
          <p>Everywhere, she learned from the country people whose way of life she shared, adopting their methods of growing, cooking and con­serving the staple foods of the Mediterranean. She described the rustic foods and dishes with feeling and fidelity, writing from the inside and with a deep sense of the history and continuity of Mediterranean ways. Her life in the Salento contrasted with an earlier, and indeed glittering, career in Fleet Street, but she sacrificed the deadlines of the past to the rhythm of wine-making, seasonal sowing and gathering.</p>
          <p>Along with recipes that feature shockingly short ingredient lists, the author chronicles her contentment with eating a plate of simply cooked vegetables and very little else for lunch or dinner. Because out-of-season, non-local produce simply didn’t exist in the places she lived, she shares ideas for feasting on the seasonal foods that are plentiful and, yes, cheapest at any given moment in the year. “A passion for youth and freshness, for grasping what the season has to give at the precise moment: This lends an ardour to daily living and eating,” she writes. And her primitive pantry demonstrates just how little you need to buy to embellish your food, when a trickle of good olive oil, a thread of wine vinegar or a sprinkle of flaky salt can make most anything taste better.</p>
