        Badminton is a racquet sport played using racquets to hit a shuttlecock across a net. Although it may be played
        with larger teams, the most common forms of the game are "singles" (with one player per side) and "doubles"
        (with
        two players per side). Badminton is often played as a casual outdoor activity in a yard or on a beach; formal
        games are played on a rectangular indoor court. Points are scored by striking the shuttlecock with the racquet
        and
        landing it within the opposing side's half of the court.
      </p>
      <br>
      <p>
        Each side may only strike the shuttlecock once before it passes over the net. Play ends once the shuttlecock has
        struck the floor or if a fault has been called by the umpire, service judge, or (in their absence) the opposing
        side.[1]
      </p>
      <br>
      <p>
        The shuttlecock is a feathered or (in informal matches) plastic projectile which flies differently from the
        balls
        used in many other sports. In particular, the feathers create much higher drag, causing the shuttlecock to
        decelerate more rapidly. Shuttlecocks also have a high top speed compared to the balls in other racquet sports.
        The flight of the shuttlecock gives the sport its distinctive nature.
      </p>
      <br>
      <p>
        The game developed in British India from the earlier game of battledore and shuttlecock. European play came to
        be
        dominated by Denmark but the game has become very popular in Asia, with recent competitions dominated by China.
        Since 1992, badminton has been a Summer Olympic sport with four events: men's singles, women's singles, men's
        doubles, and women's doubles,[2] with mixed doubles added four years later. At high levels of play, the sport
        demands excellent fitness: players require aerobic stamina, agility, strength, speed, and precision. It is also
        a
        technical sport, requiring good motor coordination and the development of sophisticated racquet movements.[3]

        Cycling, also called bicycling or biking, is the use of bicycles for transport, recreation, exercise or
        sport.[1]
        People engaged in cycling are referred to as "cyclists",[2] "bicyclists",[3] or "bikers".[4] Apart from
        two-wheeled bicycles, "cycling" also includes the riding of unicycles, tricycles, quadracycles, recumbent and
        similar human-powered vehicles (HPVs).
      </p>
      <br>
      <p>
        Bicycles were introduced in the 19th century and now number approximately one billion worldwide.[5] They are the
        principal means of transportation in many parts of the world.
      </p>
      <br>
      <p>
        Cycling is widely regarded as a very effective and efficient mode of transportation[6][7] optimal for short to
        moderate distances.
      </p>
      <br>
      <p>
        Bicycles provide numerous possible benefits in comparison with motor vehicles, including the sustained physical
        exercise involved in cycling, easier parking, increased maneuverability, and access to roads, bike paths and
        rural
        trails. Cycling also offers a reduced consumption of fossil fuels, less air or noise pollution, and much reduced
        traffic congestion. These lead to less financial cost to the user as well as to society at large (negligible
        damage to roads, less road area required). By fitting bicycle racks on the front of buses, transit agencies can
        significantly increase the areas they can serve.[8]
      </p>
      <br>
      <p>
        In addition, cycling provides a variety of health benefits. The World Health Organization (WHO) states that
        cycling can reduce the risk of cancers, heart disease, and diabetes that are prevalent in sedentary
        lifestyles.[9]
        Cycling on stationary bikes have also been used as part of rehabilitation for lower limb injuries, particularly
        after hip surgery.[10] Individuals who cycle regularly have also reported mental health improvements, including
        less perceived stress and better vitality.[11]
      </p>
      <br>
      <p>
        Among the disadvantages of cycling are the requirement of bicycles (excepting tricycles or quadracycles) to be
        balanced by the rider in order to remain upright, the reduced protection in crashes in comparison to motor
        vehicles,[12] often longer travel time (except in densely populated areas), vulnerability to weather conditions,
        difficulty in transporting passengers, and the fact that a basic level of fitness is required for cycling
        moderate
        to long distances.

      <p>
        Morris dancing is a form of English folk dance usually accompanied by music. It is based on rhythmic stepping
        and
        the execution of choreographed figures by a group of dancers, usually wearing bell pads on their shins.
        Implements
        such as sticks, swords and handkerchiefs may also be wielded by the dancers. In a small number of dances for one
        or two people, steps are near and across a pair of clay tobacco pipes laid one across the other on the floor.
        They
        clap their sticks, swords, or handkerchiefs together to match with the dance.
      </p>
      <br>
      <p>
        The earliest known and surviving English written mention of Morris dance is dated to 1448 and records the
        payment
        of seven shillings to Morris dancers by the Goldsmiths' Company in London.[1] Further mentions of Morris dancing
        occur in the late 15th century, and there are also early records such as bishops' "Visitation Articles"
        mentioning
        sword dancing, guising and other dancing activities, as well as mumming plays.
      </p>
      <br>
      <p>
        While the earliest records invariably mention "Morys" in a court setting, and a little later in the Lord Mayors'
        Processions in London, it had assumed the nature of a folk dance performed in the parishes by the mid 17th
        century.
      </p>
      <br>
      <p>
        There are around 150 Morris jingles (or teams) in the United States.[2] English expatriates form a larger part
        of
        the Morris tradition in Australia, Canada, New Zealand[3] and Hong Kong. There are isolated groups in other
        countries, for example those in Utrecht and Helmond,[4] Netherlands; the Arctic Morris Group of Helsinki,
        Finland[5] and Stockholm, Sweden; as well as in Cyprus[6] and St. Petersburg, Russia.[7]
      </p>
      <br>
      <p>
        The world of Morris is organised and supported by three organisations: Morris Ring,[8] Morris Federation[9] and
        Open Morris.[10]
