      <div class="articletitle">Is Batman Really DC Comics’ Greatest Detective?</div>
      <p class="article">
      The Caped Crusader has long held the title of “World’s Greatest Detective,” but does <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Batman">Batman</a> deserve it? The DC Universe is filled with spectacular sleuths and brilliant crime busters — including an entire intergalactic police force — so we’re taking a look at how the ‘World’s Best’ stacks up to the rest!
      For the sake of brevity, we’re going to focus on the best known contenders to the mystery-solving crown, while leaving out one-off characters, famous cameos (sorry, Sherlock), and outdated early incarnations of established characters — for example, Batman’s butler, Alfred, started off as a comedically ineffective detective.
      when an actual god gets murdered (as happened in Final Crisis), there’s only one guy you call to investigate: Batman. There are few heroes on Earth as smart as Batman, who has spent years training and honing his skills against some of the most horrifying psychopaths in the DCU (plus one dude who’s just straight up made of clay). Batman has been called ‘the most dangerous man on Earth’ (by Superman, no less), and is the only living being to ever figure a way out of Darkseid’s Omega Sanction (a “living death” that shoots the victim through time). While Batman may not be the greatest fighter in the DCU (shout out to Cassandra Cain) or the smartest person (possibly a tie between Brainiac and Mxyzptlk), there’s no one (yet) who is quite at his level in terms of sheer deductive reasoning.

      <div class="articletitle">The Greatest BATMAN Detective Stories Ever Told</div>
      <p class="article">

      Batman is many things to many people. He is justice, he is vengeance, he is the night, but most importantly he is the world’s greatest detective. It’s easy to forget in between his high-speed Batmobile chases and epic slugfests with supervillains that Batman is, at his core, a super sleuth. With superior intellect, intuition, and some incredibly expensive gadgets, Batman is always three steps ahead of the bad guys because he uses deductive reasoning to crack even the toughest cases. So, in honor of Marie Lu’s thrilling new YA novel, Batman: Nightwalker, we’re going to run down some of the greatest Batman detective stories of all time.
