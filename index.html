          <h3>This year's top pick, here's why?</h3>
          <p>With the cold being inevitable (typical life in London) and the puffer jacket labelled the ultimate jacket to keep you warm, it's no surprise why of recent it's the top choice. This jacket has evolved into a very stylish piece of apparel and is marketed in many colors, shapes and lengths. Let's not forget that some are hooded and hoodless. Many argue that whether filled with down or synthetic fibres, the puffer jacket lives up to it's intent and does a good job at keeping us warm amid bitter temperatures.

            <p>There are various ways to style this jacket but there are different rules depending on the type of puffer.
            <p>Ask yourself what length is it, what fit is it and even
              take into consideration the color of the jacket. Last but not least, have in mind the look you are trying
              to accomplish. Asking yourself these questions is very important in achieving a flawless look.</p> 
            <p>It's funny how we adopt fashion trends without knowing how they were developed and why.</p>

              <summary>History of the Puffer Winter Coat</summary>
                <p>It is argued that American adventurer Eddie Bauer created the worlds' first down jacket in 1936, for reasons of sheer necessity
                rather than for style. After almost losing his life from hypothermia on a mid-winter fishing trip. New York-based fashion
                curator, Shonagh Marshall, explains in <a

          <h1 class="main-titles">The utilitarian vibe</h1>
            <p>A puffer paired with a tracksuit. This trend has walked it's way into yet another winter season as it's favoritism has grown
            over the past couple of years. I would be right to say that this trend is simple, comfortable but chic.</p>
            <p>Our work is not done by pairing the two, next we must add accessories that compliments this pair. Try the dad trainers aka chunky trainers, it's a building trend that many are dared to try. It's effortless and easy to put together. What are your thoughts about the chunky chelsea's? I'm sure you have a pair, if not, what are you waiting for? Paired with a tracksuit and puffer, this boot elevates this simple look by adding appeal and style.</p>
            <p>Let's talk colors. Stick to similar colors, monochrome colors are also a growing favorite. Use this color wave to your advantage as we style our beloved puffy coat.

            <summary>Utilitarian Fashion</summary>
            <p>Seen as a growing trend in the industry, collections are beginning to deliberately focus on
            performance, wearability, sustainability and other qualities that introduce a whole new sub-division of reasons to
            invest in contemporary fashion. Utilitarian fashion has been known to draw inspiration from a wide variety of sources,
            including military gear, technology and futurism and outdoor apparel, often combining and overlapping themes to create
            new and unique aesthetics. Utilitarian Fashion typically has a loose-fitting unattractive shape, don't be fooled as it is one of the most sought after pieces today.

          <h1 class="main-titles">Hip to be a square</h1>
          <p>A form fitting silhouette and a puffy winter coat. Group a monokini/bodysuit with a pair of leggings and add it to a puffy coat. With the bodysuit, try a pair of tights and a mini skirt.</p>
          <p>To the eye the boxiness of the puffer compensates for the fit of the inner items which brings a very chic idea and appearance to this style. To bring even more elevation to the look choose a puffer in contrast of the outfit or vice versa. Interestingly effortless and unplanned but swanky. Let's delve a bit deeper, our choice of footwear and accessories can make or break this outfit, as we already learned, so let me show you how to choose them for this outfit. It's difficult not to pull off leggings paired with trainers, like the utilitarian look I would go for chunky or dad trainers as it balances the square shape of the jacket. However I like it better when worn with a pair of mid sock boots. This line up screams modern and edgy. Of course with chunky combat boots and even the chunky chelsea can give a sharp appearance as well. The bonus is that because they are also close fitting you can appear to be taller, just in case you're like me and 5 foot 2 inches.</p>
          <p>Add a beanie hat to this combo will bring yet another layer to this trending group. Pay attention to the color as well. It's mostly forgiving when a contrasted beanie is worn with a monochrome outfit. A much appreciated vogue look. </p>
