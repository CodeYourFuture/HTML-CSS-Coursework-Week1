            “One Dollar And Eighty-seven Cents. That was all. And sixty cents of it was in pennies. Pennies saved one and two at a
            time by bulldozing the grocer and the vegetable man and the butcher until one’s cheek burned with the silent imputation
            of parsimony that such close dealing implied. Three times Della counted it. One dollar and eighty-seven cents. And the
            next day would be Christmas.”
            
            From ‘The Gift of the Magi’, by O Henry
            
            Sometimes known as the American Maupassant, O Henry’s stories are tightly plotted narratives of ordinary lives with lots
            of humour that usually end with a classic sting in the tale that, while surprising, flows with unerring logic from the
            story’s premise.
            
            In this classic tale, we know the whole set-up within a few lines. It is Christmas and Della has no money to buy a
            present for her beloved husband James. In their whole house they possess only two things that they really value: his
            gold watch and her golden hair. In a formula that has been much copied since, we watch Della sell her golden locks to
            raise money to buy a fancy fob for James’s watch, while unbeknownst to her he has pawned his watch to buy her a set of
            ivory combs that she has long coveted for her (now departed) hair!
            
            It is a tale that sounds tragic, but is actually heartening, because in the end the couple are confirmed in their real
            gift: the love they bear each other. (Plus, of course, Della’s hair will grow back!) But it all stems from a single
            telling detail: that opening cinematic detail of a tiny sum of money, piled up in pennies and scrimped from tense
            negotiations with tradespeople, that is all Della thinks she has to show James how much she loves him.

            2. The Paradox
        </h3>
        <hr>
        <img src="story2.jpg" alt="The Telling Detail">
        <p>
            In the beginning, Sanford Carter was ashamed of becoming an Army cook. This was not from snobbery, at least not from
            snobbery of the most direct sort. During the two and a half years Carter had been in the Army he had come to hate cooks
            more and more. They existed for him as a symbol of all that was corrupt, overbearing, stupid, and privileged in Army
            life…”
            <p> From <a class="LEARN" href="https://www.esquire.com/entertainment/books/a3864/language-of-men/" target="_blank"> The Language of
                Men,by Normal Mailer.</a></p>
            
            Published in 1953, ‘The Language of Men’ tells the story of an over-sensitive, frustrated serviceman who, after years of
            being passed up for promotion and never finding his niche in the army, ends up as a cook – the thing he hates most about
            the army. Immediately we are curious: What will happen to a man who becomes the thing he most despises?
            
            Carter feels that he never manages to understand other men, to feel either equal to them or able to lead them. ‘Whenever
            responsibility had been handed to him, he had discharged it miserably, tensely, over conscientiously. He had always
            asked too many questions, he had worried the task too severely, he had conveyed his nervousness to the men he was
            supposed to lead.’
            
            Even after starting to enjoy his work as a cook, the story builds to an incident where the men come to him and ask for a
            tin of oil for a fish fry-up they are organising – a party to which he is not invited. Carter stands his ground, and
            earns some grudging respect, but then undercuts it all again after the event with his ‘unmanliness’ – the true source of
            his self-disgust.
            
            The whole drama of a man failing to fit in with and gain respect among other men is foreshadowed in the paradox that’s
            set in motion in the story’s opening lines.

            3. The Historical Backdrop
        </h3>
        <hr>
        <img src="story3.jpg" alt="The Telling Detail">
        <p>A protege of Flaubert and the author of the novel Bel-Ami, Maupassant wrote over 300 short stories, many of them – like
        this one – set during the Franco-Prussian war, and showing how innocent lives are swept up and crushed by futile, brutal
        conflict.
        
        This story starts with a brief paragraph of context and another telling detail: the absence of sparrows. At this point
        in the conflict, the Prussian army has established a blockade around Paris and is seeking to starve out its citizens.
        
        The two friends of the title were passionate fishermen in peacetime, and after a chance encounter they convince each
        other to go off and fish once again. As well as the hunger they feel, they are motivated by a hankering for a return to
        the innocent pleasures of their pre-war lives.
        
        They slip out past the French lines, to an area where they think they will be safe, but after a brief interval of bliss
        the Prussians detect them, with tragic consequences…
        
        The opening line describes the war situation in vivid, journalistic terms, after which we are plunged into the tale of
        these two innocents. In a few telling phrases, it provides context and general background for the very particular
        tragedy which is about to ensue.
        
        4. The Anecdotal Approach
        “Margot met Robert on a Wednesday night toward the end of her fall semester. She was working behind the concession stand
        at the artsy movie theatre downtown when he came in and bought a large popcorn and a box of Red Vines.
        
        “That’s an… unusual choice,” she said. “I don’t think I’ve ever actually sold a box of Red Vines before.”
        
        From ‘Cat Person,’ by Kristen Roupenian
        
        ‘Cat Person,’ reportedly the first short story ever to go viral, tells a simple tale of a doomed romantic encounter.
        Margot, a student, meets an older guy, Robert, and they begin a flirtation that turns into a date that turns into a
        rather unsatisfactory (for her) sexual encounter.
        
        Robert starts off as rather funny and charming, but over time we see that he is needy, insensitive, possessive, and
        utterly unaware of what Margot is thinking or feeling. Margot regrets the whole thing but doesn’t know how to tell him;
        Robert, when he is let down, turns all-too-predictably toxic. In short order he goes from mooning after her to demanding
        who she’s slept with to calling her a ‘whore.’
        
        This sequence of events struck a chord with many, many people because it is clearly so familiar. The story emphasises
        the banality of the whole progression by narrating events in a straightforwardly chronological, anecdotal style, right
        from the opening paragraph. This approach serves to underline the depressing banality of Robert’s misogyny while
        implicitly asking the question: Why should women have to accept this as normal?
        
        5. In Media Res
        “And after all the weather was ideal. They could not have had a more perfect day for a party if they had ordered it.
        Windless, warm, the sky without a cloud. Only the blue was veiled with a haze of light gold, as it is sometimes in early
        summer. The gardener had been up since dawn, mowing the lawns and sweeping them, until the grass and the dark flat
        rosettes where the daisy plants had been seemed to shine. As for the roses, you could not help feeling they understood
        that roses are the only flowers that -parties; the only flowers that everybody is certain of knowing. Hundreds, yes,
        literally hundreds, had come out in a single night; the green bushes bowed down as though they had been visited by
        archangels.”
        
        From ‘The Garden Party,’ by Katherine Mansfield
        
        Literally ‘in the middle of things’, an in media res beginning is where the story drops us into the middle of the action
        of the narrative, so that we are instantly caught up in events. In this case, we are plunged into the excited bustle of
        a well-to-do family preparing a sumptuous garden party, and the story does a fantastic job of building up the
        anticipation and painting a picture of the affluence of the hosts. There is a marquee to put up, a band on its way, an
        enormous delivery of fancy flowers, fifteen kinds of sandwich, and a retinue of servants to ensure everything is ready.
        
        Beginning with ‘and’ adds to this effect, giving us to understand that garden-party fever has been going on already for
        days, and seeming to hark back to earlier worries about what the weather would be like on the day. But against all this
        blithely affluent gaiety comes the story’s turning point: news that a poor workingman living in a cottage nearby has
        died in a sudden accident.
        
        Laura, a daughter of the house, wonders if it appropriate to continue with the party, especially as all the noise and
        music and bustle will carry to the grieving widow (who also has six children, we later discover). But just as happens to
        the reader with the introduction, she is swept along by the occasion, and only really reconsiders the incident at the
        end of a successful party, when her mother suggest she take a basket of sandwiches from the party down to the widow.
        Laura’s reaction to this difficult task is initially ambiguous, but ultimately it seems as if again she finds a way to
        paint the tragedy in complacently optimistic colours, choosing to find a serenity and beauty on the dead man’s face and
        so blind herself to the grim reality of the tragedy and the agony of the grieving wife.
        
        
        6. The Refrain
        “The thing about being the murdered extra is you set the plot in motion.
        
        You were a girl good at walking past cameras, background girl, corner-of-the-frame girl. Never-held-a-script girl,
        went-where-the-director-said girl.
        
        You’ll be found in an alley, it’s always an alley for girls like you, didn’t-quite-make-it girls,
        living-four-to-a-one-bedroom-apartment girls. You’ll be found in an alley, you’ll be mistaken for a broken mannequin at
        first, you’ll be given a nickname. Blue Violet, White Rose, something reminiscent of Elizabeth Short, that first girl
        like you, that most famous one. The kind of dead girl who never really dies.”
        
        From ‘Being the Murdered Extra,’ by Cathy Ulrich
        
        Cathy Ulrich’s extraordinary ‘Murdered Ladies’ flash fictions present a series of stories – there are 40 of them in her
        collection, Ghosts of You – which always begin with the same line: The thing about being the murdered
        extra/girlfriend/moll/classmate/witch/dancer [etc] is you set the plot in motion.
        
        It’s a thought-provoking line, which grows in power with every repetition. On the face of it seems strange to see these
        women as setting the plot in motion, when they are all victims of male violence. But we start to see that what they set
        in motion is actually the story that the people who survive them will appropriate from their lost lives, and blithely
        relate in their absence.
        
        Each woman may set her plot in motion, but in each case she is not alive to explain how everyone gets her wrong, or
        projects their own version of events to absolve themselves too easily. We see that this theft of each woman’s own story
        is another violence that is done to them, something the stories seek in some small way to redeem. As Ulrich says: ‘Every
        story is looking for the lost girl from the title […] I am looking for the lost in these stories. I don’t know if I will
        ever find them.’
        
        7. Setting The Rules
        “The north and the west and the south are good hunting ground, but it is forbidden to go east. It is forbidden to go to
        any of the Dead Places except to search for metal and then he who touches the metal must be a priest or the son of a
        priest. Afterwards, both the man and the metal must be purified. These are the rules and the laws; they are well made.
        It is forbidden to cross the great river and look upon the place that was the Place of the Gods—this is most strictly
        forbidden. We do not even say its name though we know its name. It is there that spirits live, and demons—it is there
        that there are the ashes of the Great Burning. These things are forbidden—they have been forbidden since the beginning
        of time.”
        
        From ‘By the Waters of Babylon,’ by Stephen Vincent Benét
        
        In any story that seeks to build a world that is not ours, there is some work to be done in establishing the reality of
        that world – its customs, its landscape, its people, its rules. World-building stories can sometimes fall down when they
        indulge in too much of an expository info dump, as the accumulation of background detail can quickly dent narrative
        momentum.
        
        What’s so clever about the start of this story is that the rules are themselves the engine of the plot. We pan
        cinematically across the edges of the story’s territory, and understand the legends and forbidden areas of this world.
        But the quest of the narrator – who is indeed the son of a priest – will take him east, into the forbidden Place of the
        Gods (about which, of course, we are already very curious). At the outset of the story we do not the time in which the
        story is set, what kind of being he is, or where he lives. But all these things will be revealed as the narrator’s
        journey through a post-apocalyptic, post-technological world takes him to places that gradually start to seem very
        familiar…
        
        8. Beginning With The Inciting Incident
        “The day my son Laurie started kindergarten he renounced corduroy overalls with bibs and began wearing blue jeans with a
        belt; I watched him go off the first morning with the older girl next door, seeing clearly that an era of my life was
        ended, my sweet-voiced nursery-school tot replaced by a longtrousered, swaggering character who forgot to stop at the
        corner and wave good-bye to me.”
        
        From ‘Charles,’ by Shirley Jackson
        
        Screenwriting guru Robert Mckee describes the inciting incident as a moment that ‘radically upsets the balance of forces
        in your protagonist’s life’. It’s the moment when our main character is plunged out of their normal routine and a
        challenge or quest appears which will shape their journey, and with it the rest of the story. It’s common to locate this
        point near the start of the story after some introductory ‘normality,’ so that we can understand how the main
        character’s life is to be disrupted.
        
        But here the inciting incident is placed by mystery and horror writer Shirley Jackson – best known for The Haunting of
        Hill House – at the very start of the story. Everything that happens flows from Laurie starting kindergarten. Laurie
        gets cheekier and less innocent with each passing day, as he brings home increasingly hair-raising tales of an even
        naughtier boy called Charles. The whole story deals with the comic escalation of Charles’ behaviour, as reader and
        narrator alike become ever more curious to meet the errant child and speculate on what his parents are like.
        
        I won’t spoil the ending, except to say that there is perhaps a clue in the mother’s lament in the opening paragraph
        about the end of an era of innocence…

        9. The Thought Experiment
        “MY LOVER IS experiencing reverse evolution. I tell no one. I don’t know how it happened, only that one day he was my
        lover and the next he was some kind of ape. It’s been a month, and now he’s a sea turtle.”
        
        From ‘The Rememberer,’ by Aimee Bender
        
        Aimee Bender’s story begins by asking the reader to imagine something extraordinarily counterfactual: that her lover is
        regressing through millennia, going through the evolutionary process so fast – a million years a day, in reverse – that
        we can actually track his progress by the day. One day he is a baboon, another a salamander; eventually he is no longer
        even visible to the naked eye.
        
        As with so many of Bendee’s stories the result is mournful, strange, poetic and profound. She takes a surreal thought
        like this and turns into a powerful meditation on memory, the difference between evolution and maturity, speciesism and
        loss. And it all begins with that challenging idea which confronts us in the very first sentence.
        
        10. THE CONUNDRUM
        “1-0. Who would expect the Embassy of Cambodia? Nobody. Nobody could have expected it, or be expecting it. It’s a
        surprise, to us all. The Embassy of Cambodia!
        
        Next door to the embassy is a health center. On the other side, a row of private residences, most of them belonging to
        wealthy Arabs (or so we, the people of Willesden, contend). They have Corinthian pillars on either side of their front
        doors, and—it’s widely believed—swimming pools out back. The embassy, by contrast, is not very grand. It is only a four-
        or five-bedroom North London suburban villa, built at some point in the thirties, surrounded by a red brick wall, about
        eight feet high. And back and forth, cresting this wall horizontally, flies a shuttlecock. They are playing badminton in
        the Embassy of Cambodia. Pock, smash. Pock, smash.”
        
        From ‘The Embassy of Cambodia,’ by Zadie Smith
        
        This subtle and absorbing story from Zadie Smith opens with a mystery: an embassy, set in a leafy north London suburb
        rather than a grand central district of the city, and a wall, behind which a mysterious game of badminton is being
        played. The rest of the story picks at this mystery and uses the imagined score in the ongoing game-playing as a
        backdrop to the unfolding tale of Fatou, a domestic servant to the affluent Derawals, who has escaped servitude and
        dodged abuse in Africa only to face privations and hardships in London.
        
        Each mini-chapter of the story is headed with a score from the badminton match – from 1-0 up to 21-0. This mechanism
        provides a rhythmic framework to the tale. We may never learn who actually holds the rackets, but we see that the
        back-and-forth motion behind the wall of an embassy – an institution with the power to grant deny or people access to
        whole a country – is a fitting counterpoint to the enforced travels of impoverished migrants, and to the desperate
        movements of Fatou’s hopes and fears in a world where she has little agency or resources, and only one friend.

            Cathy Ulrich’s extraordinary ‘Murdered Ladies’ flash fictions present a series of stories – there are 40 of them in her
            collection, Ghosts of You – which always begin with the same line: The thing about being the murdered
            extra/girlfriend/moll/classmate/witch/dancer [etc] is you set the plot in motion.
            
            It’s a thought-provoking line, which grows in power with every repetition. On the face of it seems strange to see these
            women as setting the plot in motion, when they are all victims of male violence. But we start to see that what they set
            in motion is actually the story that the people who survive them will appropriate from their lost lives, and blithely
            relate in their absence.
            
            Each woman may set her plot in motion, but in each case she is not alive to explain how everyone gets her wrong, or
            projects their own version of events to absolve themselves too easily. We see that this theft of each woman’s own story
            is another violence that is done to them, something the stories seek in some small way to redeem. As Ulrich says: ‘Every
            story is looking for the lost girl from the title […] I am looking for the lost in these stories. I don’t know if I will
            ever find them.’ <a class="LEARN" href="https://jerichowriters.com/writing-flash-fiction-complete-guide/" target="_blank">LEARN MORE.</a>
